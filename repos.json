In each video, the camera moves around the object, capturing it from different angles. The data also contain manually annotated 3D bounding boxes for each object, which describe the object\u2019s position, orientation, and dimensions. The dataset consists of 15K annotated video clips supplemented with over 4M annotated images in the following categories: `bikes, books, bottles, cameras, cereal boxes, chairs, cups, laptops`, and `shoes`. In addition, to ensure geo-diversity, our dataset is collected from 10 countries across five continents. Along with the dataset, we are also sharing a [3D object detection solution](https:\/\/google.github.io\/mediapipe\/solutions\/objectron) for four categories of objects \u2014 shoes, chairs, mugs, and cameras. These models are trained using this dataset, and are released in [MediaPipe](https:\/\/mediapipe.dev\/), Google's open source framework for cross-platform customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media.\n\n## Key Features\n- 15000 annotated videos and 4M annotated images\n- All samples include high-res images, object pose, camera pose, point-cloud, and surface planes.\n- Ready to use examples in various tf.record formats, which can be used in Tensorflow\/PyTorch.\n- Object-centric multi-views, observing the same object from different angles.\n- Accurate evaluation metrics, like 3D IoU for oriented 3D bounding boxes.\n\n\n## Dataset Format\nThe data is stored in the [objectron bucket](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/objectron) on Google Cloud storage. Check out the [Download Data](https:\/\/github.com\/google-research-datasets\/Objectron\/blob\/master\/notebooks\/Download%20Data.ipynb) notebook for a quick review of how to download\/access the dataset. The following assets are available:\n\n- The video sequences (located in `\/videos\/class\/batch-i\/j\/video.MOV` files)\n- The annotation labels containing the 3D bounding boxes for objects. The annotation protobufs are located in `\/videos\/class\/batch-i\/j\/geometry.pbdata` files. They are formatted using the [object.proto](https:\/\/github.com\/google-research-datasets\/Objectron\/blob\/master\/objectron\/schema\/object.proto). See [example] on how to parse the annotation files.\n- AR metadata (such as camera poses, point clouds, and planar surfaces). They are based on [a_r_capture_metadata.proto](https:\/\/github.com\/google-research-datasets\/Objectron\/blob\/master\/objectron\/schema\/a_r_capture_metadata.proto). See [example](https:\/\/github.com\/google-research-datasets\/Objectron\/blob\/master\/notebooks\/objectron-geometry-tutorial.ipynb) on how to parse these files.\n- Processed dataset: sharded and shuffled `tf.records` of the annotated frames, in tf.example format and videos in `tf.SequenceExample` format. These are used for creating the input data pipeline to your models. These files are located in `\/v1\/records_shuffled\/class\/` and `\/v1\/sequences\/class\/`.\n- Supporting scripts to run evaluation based on the 3D IoU metric.\n- Supporting scripts to load the data into Tensorflow, Jax and Pytorch and visualize the dataset, including \u201cHello World\u201d examples.\n- Supporting Apache Beam jobs to process the datasets on Google Cloud infrastructure.\n- The index of all available samples, as well as train\/test splits for easy access and download.\n\nRaw dataset size is 1.9TB (including videos and their annotations). Total dataset size is 4.4TB (including videos, records, sequences, etc.).

Given the script:\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app width: 300, height: 200 do\n  background lime..blue\n\n  stack do\n    para \"Welcome to the world of Shoes!\"\n    button \"Click me\" do alert \"Nice click!\" end\n    image \"http:\/\/shoesrb.com\/img\/shoes-icon.png\",\n          margin_top: 20, margin_left: 10\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis results in the following application:\n\n![shoes 4 screenshot Linux](http:\/\/www.pragtob.info\/images\/Shoes%204%20_004.png)\n\nThe look and feel will differ for your operating system, as Shoes 4 uses native widgets.\n\n## Some history about Shoes\n\nWay way back in the day, there was a guy named \\_why. He created a project known as [Hackety Hack](http:\/\/hackety-hack.com) to teach programming to everyone. In order to reach all corners of the earth, \\_why decided to make Hackety Hack work on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. This was a lot of work, and so \\_why decided to share his toolkit with the world. Thus, Shoes was born.\n\n## Preview Version\n\nHi there, thanks for checking by! Shoes 4 is in the preview stage. It currently supports almost all of the shoes DSL, but there are still some unsupported spots and [known issues](https:\/\/github.com\/shoes\/shoes4\/issues). We are now regularly releasing updated preview versions to [rubygems](http:\/\/rubygems.org\/gems\/shoes\/versions\/), for easy installation. If you're not too adventurous just yet you can still use the [old shoes](https:\/\/github.com\/shoes\/shoes)!\n\n## Installing Shoes 4\n\nThere are two ways to get your hands on Shoes 4 - the preview gem release and installing it straight from github. For both you need a current [JRuby](http:\/\/www.jruby.org\/) installation.\n\nWe recommend using JRuby 9.X+, with the majority of our testing currently against 9.1. JRuby 1.7.x *may* work, but has been untested since 4.0.0.pre6.\n\n### Get a JDK and JRuby\n\nSo your first step is to install a [JDK](http:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technetwork\/java\/javase\/downloads\/) (shoes also works with [OpenJDK](http:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/)) and [JRuby](http:\/\/jruby.org). Make sure to grab the appropriate JRuby version for your operating system. On Linux\/Mac you can also use ruby installation tools to install JRuby. For instance [rvm](http:\/\/rvm.io\/):\n\n    $ rvm install jruby\n\n**JDK version note:** JRuby version 9 requires a JDK version of **7 or 8** - **JDK 9 does not yet work with JRuby** and therefore not with Shoes.  Also within the JDK major version make sure to have the latest updates installed, we had cases where newer versions resolved bugs.\n\n**SWT requirement:** Be aware that Shoes 4 builds on [SWT](http:\/\/www.eclipse.org\/swt\/) for its default backend. That is usually no concern (other than the need for JRuby\/JDK, described above) as you do not have to install SWT yourself. However, that means we have the same basic system requirements SWT does. For Linux that means you need GTK+ >= 2.10 or >= 3.0 if you like. Moreover, as of now there is no ARM support (as the Raspberry Pi would need).\n\n### Installing Shoes 4 as a gem\n\n#### *nix (Mac OSX\/Linux)\n\n    $ gem install shoes --pre\n\n#### Windows\n\n    C:\\tmp> jruby -S gem install shoes --pre\n\n### Installing Shoes 4 from github\n\nIf you want to be on the bleeding edge or want to contribute code you need to install it straight from the github repository.\n\n#### *nix (Mac OSX\/Linux)\n\n1. Fork the repository and clone your fork, or\n\n        $ git clone git:\/\/github.com\/shoes\/shoes4.git\n\n2. Set up your local environment\n\n        $ cd shoes4\n        $ gem install bundler && bundle install\n\n  Note: If you got rvm, rbenv or something like that installed it might complain  that you should use jruby version xx. That's because we keep our .ruby-version files up to date. You should be able to run it with a JRuby version >= 9.0.0.0 We recommend up to date versions though.\n\n3. You're ready to go!\n\n#### Windows\n\n1. Fork the repository and clone your fork, or\n\n        C:\\tmp> git clone git:\/\/github.com\/shoes\/shoes4.git\n\n2. Set up your local environment\n\n        C:\\tmp>cd shoes4\n        C:\\tmp\\shoes4>jruby -S gem install bundler\n        C:\\tmp\\shoes4>jruby -S bundle install\n\n3. You're ready to go!\n\n## Running a Shoes App\n\nShoes 4 comes with a command-line app runner. Just pass it the filename of your Shoes app.\n\n    $ bin\/shoes samples\/simple_sound.rb\n\n**Note:** For Windows, `C:\\tmp\\shoes4>bin\\shoes samples\\simple_sound.rb` If you installed Shoes 4 as a gem, just do `C:\\tmp> shoes path\\to\\file.rb`\n\nThere is also a simple ruby starter script when using the SWT backend which you may use as follows:\n\n    $ bin\/shoes-swt samples\/simple_sound.rb\n\nThis does not work yet on Mac as JRuby (the JVM) needs some additional parameters. Here you can just do the following (which basically is what bin\/shoes does):\n\n    $ jruby -J-XstartOnFirstThread bin\/shoes-swt samples\/simple_sound.rb\n\nAnother alternative yet is to put `require 'shoes'` at the top of your applications, then you can simply do\n\n    $ jruby path\/to\/file.rb\n\nOn OS X you still need to supply the additional parameters to JRuby\n\n    $ jruby -J-XstartOnFirstThread path\/to\/file.rb\n\n## Want to see what shoes can do?\n\nYou can run `rake samples` and random samples we believe are working will be run until you quit with Ctr + C. Some of them are really simple, while others are more complex or even games!\nIf you notice any issue with those samples please [let us know](https:\/\/github.com\/shoes\/shoes4\/issues\/new)!\n\nBy setting the `SHOES_USE_INSTALLED` environment variable to true, you can also use your installed version of shoes (`shoes` command) to run the samples instead of the local `bin\/shoes`.\n\n## Packaging a Shoes App\n\nPackaging is just a baby, so be gentle.\n\nIn order to package an app, you need to have the Shoes gem installed in your environment. If you didn't do the gem installation you can always generate a gem and install it from the current source:\n\n    $ rake install:all\n\nNow, you can package an app. But first, look here:\n\n- The packager will include ***everything*** in the directory of your shoes script and below, unless you tell it not to.\n- The packager will probably not work properly if it detects a `.gemspec` or a `Gemfile`. It uses Warbler, which always looks for those files. If you run the specs, you may notice some warnings like this:\n\n> warning: Bundler \\`path' components are not currently supported.\n> The \\`shoes-4.0.0.pre1' component was not bundled.\n> Your application may fail to boot!\n\nThat's Warbler talking. Actually, we sneak the Shoes gem in anyway, but don't tell.\n\nOkay, now for real. The simplest thing is to put your script in a directory by itself and then:\n\n    $ bin\/shoes package --mac path\/to\/directory-of\/your-shoes-app.rb\n\nThis will produce a Mac app, which you can then find at `path\/to\/directory-of\/pkg\/your-shoes-app.app`.\n\nYou can also package a shoes app up as a jar through:\n\n    $ bin\/shoes package --jar path\/to\/directory-of\/your-shoes-app.rb\n\nYou can find the jar in the same directory as above, i.e. path\/to\/directory-of\/pkg\/your-shoes-app.jar\n\nIf you want more control (like you want to name your app something besides \"Shoes App\", or you don't want to include all of those files we talked about before), make an `app.yaml` file. See [the example](https:\/\/github.com\/shoes\/shoes4\/blob\/master\/app.yaml) for more details.\n\n***Note:*** *If you use an `app.yaml`, you will have to customize or comment out each option. The example is just an example ;)*\n\nWhen you have an `app.yaml` file right next to your script, you have three options:\n\n    $ bin\/shoes package --mac path\/to\/directory-of\/your-shoes-app.rb\n    $ bin\/shoes package --mac path\/to\/directory-of\/app.yaml\n    $ bin\/shoes package --mac path\/to\/directory-of\n\nThe packager will find your instructions using any of those commands. Again, you'll find your app in the `pkg` directory inside your project's directory. Find out more at `bin\/shoes --help`.\n\nOh, and you can also just run your Shoes apps with `bin\/shoes`.\n\n## Want to contribute?\n\nThat's awesome, thank you!\n\nYou can go ahead an try to fix one of our [issues](https:\/\/github.com\/shoes\/shoes4\/issues).\nWe have introduced a new tag 'Newcomer Friendly' for issues we believe are suitable to get started with shoes contributing. These issues either are relatively easy to accomplish or don't depend on a lot of other shoes code (e.g. completely new features) so that it's easier to get started.\nPlease feel free to tackle any issue - we will help you if needed. The tag is just a suggestion! =)\n\nAlso there is a list of samples that already work at samples\/README, along with all the other samples. You can try to get a new sample to run. In order to do so you can run `rake non_samples` to run a random sample we think does not work. If you just want to list the non working samples you can also run `rake list_non_samples`.\n\nWith all you do, please make sure to write specs as Shoes 4 is developed TDD-style (see the [Running Specs](https:\/\/github.com\/shoes\/shoes4#running-specs) section below). So make sure that you don't break any tests :-)\n\nIf you feel unsure about testing or your implementation just open an issue or a pull request. Pull requests don't need to be done - they are great discussion starters! We're happy to help you get your contribution ready to be merged in order to help build Shoes 4!\n\nIn fact we greatly appreciate early pull requests to review code and help you find your way around Shoes 4! =)\n\nIf you have questions, also feel free to drop by on the #shoes channel on FreeNode irc. People might not respond instantly, but after some time someone will respond :-)\n\nIt sometimes is also a good way to refactor some code or write some specs in order to get familiar with a project. If you want to try this approach you can have a look at our [Code Climate](https:\/\/codeclimate.com\/github\/shoes\/shoes4) to find candidates for refactoring or after running the specs locally take a peak into the coverage directory and open index.html - it shows you our current coverage data. See something that isn't covered and maybe you can write a spec for it?\n\nRefer to the following section for information on how to run the specs, that were mentioned before :-)\n\n## Running Specs\n\nShoes 4 is developed in a TDD style using RSpec. You should be writing and running the specs :)\n\nThe simplest way to do this is with rake tasks.\n\n    $ bundle exec rake\n\n(Try `rake --tasks` for a full list)\n\nIf you want more details on other modes to run specs in, philosophy on how and what to tests, check out the [Testing Shoes entry in the wiki](https:\/\/github.com\/shoes\/shoes4\/wiki\/Testing-Shoes).\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nWay way back in the day, there was a guy named _why.

It is intended to be \"just enough\" of a tool to efficently write maintainable cross-browser JavaScript. The API is modeled after jQuery but we intentionally implement a tiny subset of the API to cover only the methods we commonly need in our projects.  Each feature is built as an optional extension to a minimal core so each can be removed from the production build (dependencies between extensions are rare). The selector engine delegates to modern browsers' native `document.querySelectorAll` (IE8) and `addEventListener` (IE9), which means it requires browsers that support those features. For projects that require deeper compatibility or a richer set of features, it is simple to swap in jQuery instead. As a rule, anything that works with Shoestring should work with jQuery, but not the converse.\n\nOur goal is to strike a good balance of code weight, runtime speed, browser support, and developer convenience. \n\n\n## Features\n\nShoestring's API is inspired by jQuery.\n\nTechnically, shoestring.js is a very small, extendable core function. That core function doesn't come with much more than a means of finding and\/or generating HTML elements, a DOM-ready handler, and a few essential element-traversal methods like `each`, `find`, `children`. Using its `shoestring.fn` API, its core is easy to extend further, and many extensions are available for you to include in your build \u2013 the default build includes all extensions, but it's still very small (~3kb compressed).\n\nIf you are concerned about compatibility issues\/pitfalls consider using the development build releases (`-dev` in the [releases](https:\/\/github.com\/filamentgroup\/shoestring\/releases)). We've endeavored to throw exceptions where a particular invocation pattern or feature isn't supported as a means to document the disparity. We recommend that you use the development version in development and the regular non-`-dev` version in production.\n\nThere are three sets of extensions to the Shoestring core: DOM manipulation, events, and ajax.\n\n### DOM\n\nIf you've used jQuery, the structure and behavior of the DOM manipulation methods will be immediately familiar:\n\n```javascript\nshoestring( \".foo\" ).addClass( \"bar\" ).attr( \"data-baz\", \"bak\" );\n```\n\nThat is, construct a sequence of elements from the DOM and invoke each method on all the elements of the sequence in turn. You can find a full list of the supported DOM methods and their arguments in the [API docs](http:\/\/filamentgroup.github.io\/shoestring\/dist\/docs\/) under the `dom\/*` subdirectory.\n\n### Events\n\nShoestring supports most of the jQuery events API including: custom events that bubble, event namespaces, a normalized event object, event arguments, DOM Ready, a `.one` method, comprehensive `.unbind`, etc. The major difference here is that Shoestring does not support the event delegation helpers built into jQuery, like `.delegate` or `.on` with a selector argument.\n\n```javascript\nshoestring( \".foo\" ).bind( \"click\", function( event ) { ... });\n```\n\nOr with a custom event triggered on a child element:\n\n\n```javascript\nshoestring( \".foo\" ).bind( \"bar\", function( event, arg ) {\n  ...\n  if(arg == 1) { ... }\n  ...\n});\n\n\/\/ ...\n\nshoestring( \".foo\" ).children().first().trigger( \"bar\", 1 );\n```\n\nYou can find a full list of the supported event methods and their arguments in the [API docs](http:\/\/filamentgroup.github.io\/shoestring\/dist\/docs\/) under the `events\/*` subdirectory.\n\n\n### Ajax\n\nShoestring supports a full `shoestring.ajax` method as well as some shorthand helpers like `shoestring.get` and `shoestring.post`.\n\n```javascript\nshoestring.ajax( \"\/foo\", {\n  success: function(){ ... },\n  method: \"GET\",\n  ...\n});\n```\n\nWhich could also be accomplished using `shoestring.get`\n\n```javascript\nshoestring.get( \"\/foo\", function(){ ... });\n```\n\nYou can find a full list of the supported ajax methods and their arguments in the [API docs](http:\/\/filamentgroup.github.io\/shoestring\/dist\/docs\/) under the `ajax\/*` subdirectory.\n\n\n## Extensions\n\nExtending Shoestring is done in nearly the same fashion as jQuery. There is an object on which you can define properties using functions and those functions will have access to the Shoestring DOM element sequence during invocation using `this`. As an example the `remove` method:\n\n```javascript\n\/**\n * Remove the current set of elements from the DOM.\n *\n * @return shoestring\n * @this shoestring\n *\/\nshoestring.fn.remove = function(){\n  return this.each(function(){\n    if( this.parentNode ) {\n      this.parentNode.removeChild( this );\n    }\n  });\n};\n```\n\nIt uses the `each` method to handle the DOM elements in the current sequence in turn.\n\n**NOTE** these definitions must be made before a Shoestring object that depends on them is constructed. This is in contrast with jQuery where each object has access to new methods through the prototype chain.\n\n### Modules\n\nEach extension to Shoestring included in the repository is defined as an AMD module, but only for build purposes. We don't support, or plan to support, loading the library as modules in the browser.\n\n```javascript\n\/\/>>excludeStart(\"exclude\", pragmas.exclude);\ndefine([ \"shoestring\", \"dom\/remove\" ], function(){\n\/\/>>excludeEnd(\"exclude\");\n\nshoestring.fn.foo = function(){ ... };\n\n\/\/>>excludeStart(\"exclude\", pragmas.exclude);\n});\n\/\/>>excludeEnd(\"exclude\");\n```\n\nNote that the AMD wrapper is removed during the process of the build and that the dependencies are defined from the `src` subdirectory. More on custom builds below.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nBrowsing the modules in Shoestring you'll notice that very few have explicit dependencies in their module definitions. This is by design. We are interested in being able to select the minimum number of methods necessary for a given project to reduce load and parse times.\n\n## Builds\n\nShoestring releases include two different builds, one for development and one for production. The development build is larger. It is intended to help with jQuery compatibility issues and includes other development utilities like the method tracker. The production build is meant to be shipped in production and does not include the extra dev-time helpers.\n\n### Custom\n\nThis repository supports custom builds through creating a meta-module in the `build\/custom\/` directory and running the default Grunt task. To get started building a custom production build, do the following:\n\n1. make sure the project dependencies are installed with `npm install`\n2. copy `build\/development.js` to `build\/custom\/foo.js`\n3. run `grunt` or `node node_modules\/.bin\/grunt`\n4. use `dist\/foo.js`\n\n### Tracker\n\nIncluded in the development build is a method tracker. It works by proxying all calls to `shoestring.fn` methods through a corresponding method that records the invocation in local storage. **NOTE** this does not include methods defined on `shoestring`. Then the methods being used across pages by your application can be inspected.\n\n```javascript\nJSON.parse( window.localStorage.getItem(shoestring.trackedMethodsKey) );\n```\n\nIf the method tracker is included during a significant portion of development this list can be used to remove unused functions from your Shoestring build with a custom meta-module.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n","5":"# Adidas Shoes Ecommerce App UI\n\n![](assets\/preview.jpg)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis project is a starting point for a Flutter application.\n\nA few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:\n\n- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https:\/\/flutter.io\/docs\/get-started\/codelab)\n- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https:\/\/flutter.io\/docs\/cookbook)\n\nFor help getting started with Flutter, view our \n[online documentation](https:\/\/flutter.io\/docs), which offers tutorials, \nsamples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.\n","6":"\n<p align=\"center\">\n  \n<img src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/druv5319\/Sneaks-API\/blob\/master\/Screenshots\/Sneaks_Logo.png?raw=true\" width=250>\n  \n  <\/p>\n  \n<p align=\"center\">\n  \n   <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/sneaks-api\" alt=\"Version\">\n        <img src=\"https:\/\/img.shields.io\/npm\/v\/sneaks-api\" \/><\/a>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/sneaks-api\" alt=\"Downloads\">\n        <img src=\"https:\/\/img.shields.io\/npm\/dt\/sneaks-api \" \/><\/a>\n\n\n <\/p>\n\nA StockX API, FlightClub API, Goat API, and Stadium Goods API all in one.\n\nSneaks API is a sneaker API built using Node.JS, Express, and Got.

Clone this repository using git\n\n- Open a terminal (in Windows, you can do `CTRL + R` then type `cmd` and hit `ENTER`)\n- Enter the following:\n\n`git clone https:\/\/github.com\/tylerburleigh\/nike-buy-bot.git`\n\n2. Make sure you are in the bot directory within the terminal\n\n`cd nike-buy-bot`\n\n3. Install the Node.js dependencies\n\n`npm install`\n\n4. Using a text editor, edit the `bot.js` file in the bot directory. In this file, look for the section called `Parameters to set`. These are the parameters to change:\n\n- user\n- pass\n- cv_code\n- size\n- url\n- debug\n- buy\n\n5. Run the bot\n\nOnce you've configured the bot, you can run it\n\n`node bot.js`\n\nIdeally, you would run it right around the time of the drop.\n\n# Screenshots\n\nThe bot works in a series of 9 \"rounds\", which include loading the shoe page, finding and clicking the desired shoe size, adding it to the cart, logging into your Nike.com account, and submitting an order.\n\n## Round 1 - Loading the shoe page\n![Round 1 - Loading the shoe page](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/tylerburleigh\/nike-buy-bot\/master\/extras\/demo_screenshots\/bot__1_loaded_1576250190.png)\n\n## Round 2 - Finding\/scrolling to the size selectors\n![Round 2 - Finding\/scrolling to the size selectors](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/tylerburleigh\/nike-buy-bot\/master\/extras\/demo_screenshots\/bot__2_selectors_1576250192.png)\n\n## Round 3 - Clicking the desired shoe size selector\n![Round 3 - Clicking the desired shoe size selector](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/tylerburleigh\/nike-buy-bot\/master\/extras\/demo_screenshots\/bot__3_size_clicked_1576250193.png)\n\n## Round 4 - Scrolling to the add-to-cart button\n![Round 4 - Scrolling to the add-to-cart button](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/tylerburleigh\/nike-buy-bot\/master\/extras\/demo_screenshots\/bot__4_scroll_to_add_button_1576250195.png)\n\n## Round 5 - Clicking the add-to-cart button\n![Round 5 - Clicking the add-to-cart button](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/tylerburleigh\/nike-buy-bot\/master\/extras\/demo_screenshots\/bot__5_clicked_add_button_1576250196.png)\n\n## Round 6 - Logging in when the login modal appears\n![Round 6 - Logging in when the login modal appears](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/tylerburleigh\/nike-buy-bot\/master\/extras\/demo_screenshots\/bot__6_logged_in_1576250198.png)\n\n## Round 7 - Entering the 3-digit credit card validation\n![Round 7 - Entering the 3-digit credit card validation](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/tylerburleigh\/nike-buy-bot\/master\/extras\/demo_screenshots\/bot__7_entered_cv_1576250203.png)\n\n## Round 8 - Clicking the \"Save & Continue\" button\n![Round 8 - Clicking the \"Save & Continue\" button](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/tylerburleigh\/nike-buy-bot\/master\/extras\/demo_screenshots\/bot__8_save_continue_1576250204.png)\n\n## Round 9 - Clicking the \"Submit Order\" button\n(not shown here)\n","8":"## Flutter Shoes Shop Application UI Design and Animation\n\nA part of #flutter100daysofcode.

is Shoes 3.3 (Walkabout). Download binaries for your platfrom from\n<http:\/\/shoesrb.com>\n\nEarlier releases of Shoes were Raisins, Policeman and Federales (2.0, 3.1 and 3.2)\nThere is a Shoes 4 under development. For historical reasons (the \ncolor of the icon in Raisins), it's also called Red Shoes. Red Shoes is written\nin C (and some Objective C on the Mac). Shoes 4 is written in Java. \n\n[Federales](https:\/\/github.com\/Shoes\/shoes3\/blob\/master\/README.federales)\nwas a maintenance release to keep Red Shoes current with modern \nLinux, OSX, and Windows distributions and newer versions of Ruby and ruby gems.\nFederales didn't really add any new features to Shoes except that it works now.\nThe packaging ability is working again!\n\nWalkabout (Shoes 3.3) does add new features to Shoes Features that may not be\ncompatible with Shoes 4. \n\n* new options for packaging. \n* Uses a more modern Ruby (2.2.+) and Ruby Gems (2.4.+)\n* Shoes can display SVG files and sub-sections (group name) of them.\n* Video widgets work again. Dependent on all kinds of thing Shoes can't\n  control.\n  \nThe latest stable version is 3.3.6; you can read about it [here](https:\/\/walkabout.mvmanila.com\/2018\/03\/03\/shoes-3-3-6), and download it from [here](https:\/\/walkabout.mvmanila.com\/public\/shoes).\n\nRemember, no one is happy if the Shoes don't fit so [report your bug.](https:\/\/github.com\/Shoes3\/shoes3\/issues)\n  \n  \n# Run, Build Shoes with Docker!\n\nIf you haven't already add your user to the docker group:\n\t`sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`\n\n `cd` into your the cloned shoes3 repo to build docker:\n  `cd shoes3\/` then run `docker build -t shoes-dev .`\n\n To run shoes apps from docker simple run:\n  `docker run --net=host --env=\"DISPLAY\" --volume=\"$HOME\/.Xauthority:\/root\/.Xauthority:rw\" shoes-dev samples\/simple\/calc.rb`\n","13":"# STATUS\n:red_circle: No longer working and not supported.\n\n\n# Adidas Bot\n\nLaunches instances of puppeteer browsers to a specified url and notifies you when an adidas cart page is detected.\n\n\n## Installation\nInstall [Node.JS](https:\/\/nodejs.org\/en\/download\/) and NPM (NPM is included with Node.JS) \n\nInstall [git](https:\/\/git-scm.com\/downloads)\n\nClone or download the repository:\n\n```\ngit clone https:\/\/github.com\/Joxroxagain\/adidas-bruteforcer.git\n```\nNavigate to the folder to which you downloaded the files.\n\nIf you want to use the google login feature, use the chrome extension EditThisCookie to export your google cookies as JSON and enter the output into the file ```cookies.json```\n\nEdit the config file as you wish.\n\nInstall the modules with the following:\n\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\nThen run the following commands to start:\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\n## Configuration settings\nOpen the file ```config.json``` and be careful to adhere to the JSON syntax in order to avoid launch errors.\n\n**Launch options:**\n\n**```url```**: The url that the browsers will go to. For yeezy drops, use ```https:\/\/www.adidas.com\/yeezy```.\n\n**```taskCount```**: The number of browsers that will be launched.\n\n**```region```**: The region that the bot will operate in. Current suported regions are:\n```AU, AT, BE, BR, CA, CN, CZ, DK, FI, FR, DE, IE, IT, MX, NL, NZ, PH, PL, RU, SK, ES, SE, GB, US```\n\n**```splashMode```**: Set to \"true\" for Yeezy releases and other releases with splash pages. Change to 'false' for all other releases. When enabled, this option makes the browsers wait for a cookie called the 'hmac' which indicates that the add to cart (ATC) page has been reached.\n\n**```headless```**: Enables the use of chrome headless which makes all the browsers invisible until the ATC page is detected. Recomended use to to keep this set to false in case something goes wrong and you need to manually add shoes to cart.\n\n**```headlessAfterSplash```**: Enables chrome headless after the shoe has been added to cart. This is currently not recomended in case there are errors during checkout and manual intervention is needed.\n\n**```splashCookieKeyword```**: Sets the keyword that indicates an ATC page. Default is `hmac` and will be changed if necessary.\n\n**```captchaExpected```**: Set this to 'true' if there will be a captcha to solve sometime during the process. In most cases, this will need to be left as 'true' but it can be disabled to test on non-hyped releases. For this option to work, you will need to have set up [<b>2captcha<\/b>](https:\/\/2captcha.com?from=5308824).\n\n**```webdata```**: This option allows the browsers to use the same webdata as your normal chrome installation (information such as your chrome autofill data, bookmarks, and passwords). This is usefull for manual checkout using chrome autofill. The ```enabled``` sub-option enables this feature and the ```path``` sub-option is only used when the bot cannot auto-detect the path to your chrome data (working on Windows 10 but needs testing on Mac and Linux).\n\n**```autoCart```**: This option enables auto-carting of shoes. Due to the constant changes to adidas splash pages, this feature may not always work. I recomend using this only when the status indicator above says that it is working. To enable, set the ```enabled``` sub-option to 'true' and input the sizes that you want to cart into the ```sizes``` sub-option, seperated by commas. The ```PID``` field allows you to enter the product ID of the shoe you want to cart. Although the bot can usually detect the product ID, entering it can prevent failures.\n\n**```twocaptcha```**: This option enables the auto captcha solving feature using the [<b>2captcha<\/b>](https:\/\/2captcha.com?from=5308824) procvider. Enter your api key into the ```apiKey``` field and set the ```enabled``` option to 'true' in order to enable it. **Important**: This must be set up in order for auto carting to work on releases.\n\n**```autoCheckout```**: This options enables auto checkout of a shoe after it has been added to cart. Enable this feature by changing the ```enabled``` sub-option to 'true' and by filling out your correct billing information under the ```data``` sub-option.\n\n**```retryDelay```**: Sets the number of milliseconds to wait before retrying various operations such as auto-carting and auto-checkout.\n\n**```startUpDelayInterval```**: Sets the number of milliseconds to wait between launching browsers. At least a few seconds is recomended because this will prevent IP bans from too much traffic at once.\n\n**```splashDetectionInterval```**: Sets the number of milliseconds to wait between checks for the add to cart (ATC) page. Very low values (under 10) causes extra load on your computer.\n\n**```alerts```**: When enabled, you will recieve a notification when a browser has passed the splash page or when a recaptcha has been discovered.\n\n**```windowHeight```** and **```windowWidth```**: Change these values to set the size (in pixels) of the browsers viewports. \n\n## Features\n- [x] Auto-updating keeps you on the latest release\n- [x] Auto add to cart, via speified sizes or random sizes\n- [x] Auto checkout via credit card\n- [x] Stock monitoring\n- [x] Cart page detection and notification system\n- [x] Google cookie import for captcha prevention\n- [x] Headless mode\n- [x] Detection prevention\n- [x] Random user-agent\n- [x] Autofill via profiles (chrome autofill imported from your bvrowser)\n- [x] Delay between browser launches\n- [x] Proxies, imported by proxies.txt file in `IP:PORT` format\n- [x] Captcha harvesting with 2captcha\n- [x] Support for all regions\n\n## TODO \n- [ ] Checkout success\/failure detection\n\n## Credits\n[<b>bequadro<\/b>](https:\/\/github.com\/bequadro\/kju) for some code\n\n## License\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details\n","14":"# vim-textobj-variable-segment\n\nA vim plugin providing a single text object (on `iv` and `av`) for\nvariable segments.

All these classes inheret from their TkInter counterparts so you can use them just as you would their original TkInter counterparts if need be.\n\nTo use this library I'd reccommend simply adding this to the top of your script;\n```python\nfrom sandals import *\n```\nHow to create windows\n--\n\nContext managers are used to create windows, stacks (columns) and flows (rows).\n\nFor example, this is how a context manager is used to make a window;\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<b>CODE<\/b>\n<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<b>GUI<\/b>\n<\/td>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<pre lang=\"python\">\nfrom sandals import *\n\nwith window(\"My window\"):\n  label(\"Hello world\")\n<\/pre>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/georgewalton\/Sandals\/master\/example%20images\/helloworld.png\"\nalt=\"Manipulating buttons example\">\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n\nThe way stacks and flows work was intended to be the same as with the Ruby library Shoes, but it's not quite there yet.\nInfo on how they're meant to work can be found on the Ruby Shoes website: http:\/\/shoesrb.com\/\n\nAs mentioned below, the library needs to be ideally be rewritten to use TkInter grids, rather than just packing elements in different ways, which is something I'm working on at the moment.\nThe @button and other GUI decorators\n--\n\nAdding the decorator \n```python \n@button \n```\nto a function adds a button that triggers that function. The button is located in whatever context manager the function is defined in.\n\n\nFor example, this code will create a window with a button, which when clicked will create a popup;\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<b>CODE<\/b>\n<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<b>GUI<\/b>\n<\/td>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<pre lang=\"python\">\nfrom sandals import *\n\nwith window():\n\n  @button(\"Create a popup box\")\n  def makePopupBox():\n    showInfo(message = \"You clicked the button\")\n<\/pre>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/georgewalton\/Sandals\/master\/example%20images\/buttonexample.png\"\nalt=\"Button example\">\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n\nCheckboxes, radio buttons, spin boxes, scale bars, and option menus can all be applied as decorators in a similar way. They are also located in whatever context manager (window, stack or flow) the function is defined in.\nFor example, here is a simple implementation of a check box to change a boolean; \n\n```python\n@checkBox(\"Is the oven on?\", checked = True)\ndef ovenOn(checked):\n\ttheOvenIsOn = checked\n```\n\nAnd here is a simple example of how to implement an options menu;\n\n```python\nlabel(\"How's the oven?\")\n@optionMenu(\"clean\", \"dirty\", \"broken\")\ndef ovenState(option):\n\tprint \"The oven is\", option\n```\n\nAll these decorators can also be used as classes where this is more convenient.\nManipulating buttons\n---\nBecause these decorators inherit from their TkInter classes, they can be used as normal (i.e. not as decorators) and then configured using e.g. ```my_button.config(**kwargs)```.\n\nButtons can be altered even when created as a decorator, as they are added as a function attribute of the function they are applied to, so can be accessed via e.g.  ```my_function.button```.\n\nAll the TkInter adjectives used to modify buttons - such as ```DISABLE``` and  ```NORMAL``` which describe the state of a disabled and enabled button respectively - are imported as well.\n\nHere is an example where this method is used to disable a button created using a decorator;\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<b>CODE<\/b>\n<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<b>GUI<\/b>\n<\/td>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<pre lang=\"python\">\nfrom sandals import *\n\nwith window():\n\n\t@button(\"This button does nothing\")\n\tdef doNothing():\n\t\tpass\n\t\t\n\t@button(\"Disable button\")\n\tdef disableButton():\n\t\tdoNothing.button.config(state = DISABLED)\n<\/pre>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/georgewalton\/Sandals\/master\/example%20images\/manipulatingbuttonsexample.png\"\nalt=\"Manipulating buttons example\">\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n\nThe @repeat and @loop decorators\n---\nTwo new decorators are included which you might not necessarily associate with a GUI library;\nThe ``@repeat`` and ``@loop`` decorators.\n\nThese create a thread that repeats or loops the function the decorator is applied to. Once the context the decorated function is defined in is destroyed (e.g. closing a window) then that thread is stopped and the function will stop repeating or looping. As an example, here is a function that repeats once a minute;\n\n```python\n@repeat(60)\ndef clock():\n\tprint \"A minute has passed\"\n```\n\nThe repeat and loop decorators are inspired by similar methods in Shoes, which turn out to be more useful than you might expect when designing a GUI.\n\nChanging and reading text in GUI elements\n--\n\nHow the text in labels and other GUI elements is changed to try and make them easier to work with.\n\nA slightly more complex example that demonstrates this;\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<b>CODE<\/b>\n<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<b>GUI<\/b>\n<\/td>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<pre lang=\"python\">\nfrom sandals import *\nwith window(\"This is a window\"):\n    label(\"This is a label\",\n    font = \"Verdana 24 bold underline\")\n    with stack(padx=10):\n        myLabel = label(\"This text changes\")\n        @button(\"Change the above text\",\n            font = \"Veranda 12 italic\")\n        def change_that_text():\n            myLabel.text = \"OMG it changed\"\n        with flow(pady=10):\n            edit = editBox(\"edit me\")\n            @button(\"<-read edit box\")\n            def read_edit_box():\n                showInfo(message\n\t\t\t\t= \"Edit box says: \"\n\t\t\t\t+ edit.text)\n<\/pre>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/georgewalton\/Sandals\/master\/example%20images\/simpleexample.png\"\nalt=\"Simple example\">\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\nComplete example\n--\n\n`example.py` has a more complete example of how to use the different methods, context managers, etc. which should look like this;\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<b>GUI<\/b>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/georgewalton\/Sandals\/master\/example%20images\/example.png\"\nalt=\"Complex example\">\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n\nwhich is a bit of a mess.\n\nTodo\n--\nIdeally this library should be rewritten at some point to use TkInter grids, instead of just packing GUI elements. I'm trying to re-write it this way at the moment.\n\n3rd-party content\n--\n\nThis library uses the AutoScrollbar class by Fredrik Lundh for the autohiding scrollbars;\n\nhttp:\/\/effbot.org\/zone\/tkinter-autoscrollbar.htm\n","20":"Nike-Bot\n========\n\nAS OF 1\/1\/2016, THIS IS NO LONGER WORKING. IT WAS MERELY AN EXERCISE TO DEMONSTRATE HOW DUMB IT IS TO BUY BOTS FROM RESELLERS.\n\nJust a bit of JS + PHP that, when loaded as a Chrome extension, aids in automating the first two steps of purchasing limited shoe releases from [Nike](http:\/\/nike.com) via [Twitter](http:\/\/www.twitter.com). \n\nAfter clicking the [@nikestore](http:\/\/twitter.com\/nikestore) release link, the specified shoe size and amount are automatically added to your cart. \n\nThese two values are set inside [autocart.js](\/chrome-extension\/autocart.js).\n\n        var size = \"12\";\n        var amount = 1;\n\nAutomating the first two steps of picking a size and amount doesn't seem very useful, but when limited release URLs are being hit by literally millions of people at once every second counts.\n\n> Nike's newest release platform is Twitter, sending out unique direct purchase URLs for each of its limited shoe releases to millions of thirsty sneakerheads around the globe. Some people started selling a \"program\" that would automatically add pairs to the user's cart that would \"work on both Mac and PC\". :\/ \n\n> This made me think that it was probably just a simple piece code that sets the size and amount values upon page load. This, coupled with the fact that they were selling it for $50-100 apiece, made me think I could write my own. Thus, nike-bot!\n\n\n\nSet Up\n---------------------\n\n1.

The `width` and `height` properties of the `<canvas>` element should be set. They define the resolution of the canvas and the final rendering will be computed using this resolution. Be careful to not enlarge too much the canvas size using its CSS properties without increasing its resolution, otherwise it may look blurry or pixelated. We advise to fix the resolution to the actual canvas size. Do not forget to call `WEBARROCKSHAND.resize()` if you resize the canvas after the initialization step.\n\n```html\n<canvas width=\"600\" height=\"600\" id='yourCanvas'><\/canvas>\n```\n\nThis canvas will be used by WebGL both for the computation and the rendering of the video. It is not costly to render the video using this canvas because the video is already transfered into a `WebGLTexture` element to feed the neural network. And it allows to apply shader effects to the video.\n\nWhen your page is loaded you should launch this function:\n```javascript\nWEBARROCKSHAND.init({\n  canvasId: 'yourCanvas',\n  NNsPaths: [...], \/\/ path to JSON neural networks models\n  callbackReady: function(errCode, spec){\n    if (errCode){\n      console.log('AN ERROR HAPPENS. ERROR CODE =', errCode);\n      return;\n    }\n    [init scene with spec...]\n    console.log('INFO: WEBARROCKSHAND IS READY');\n  }, \/\/end callbackReady()\n\n  \/\/ called at each render iteration (drawing loop)\n  callbackTrack: function(detectState){\n    \/\/ render your scene here\n    [... do something with detectState]\n  } \/\/end callbackTrack()\n});\/\/end init call\n```\n\n\n\n### Optionnal init arguments\n* `<integer> animateDelay`: Number of milliseconds during which the browser wait at the end of the rendering loop before starting another detection. The default value is `1`,\n* `<function> onWebcamAsk`: Function launched just before asking for the user to allow access to its camera,\n* `<function> onWebcamGet`: Function launched just after the user has accepted to share its video. It is called with the video element as argument,\n* `<dict> videoSettings`: override MediaStream API specified video settings, which are by default:\n```javascript\n{\n  'videoElement' \/\/ not set by default. <video> element used\n   \/\/ If you specify this parameter,\n   \/\/ all other settings will be useless\n   \/\/ it means that you fully handle the video aspect\n\n  'deviceId'            \/\/ not set by default\n  'facingMode': 'user', \/\/ to use the rear camera, set to 'environment'\n\n  'idealWidth': 800,  \/\/ ideal video width in pixels\n  'idealHeight': 600, \/\/ ideal video height in pixels\n  'minWidth': 480,    \/\/ min video width in pixels\n  'maxWidth': 1280,   \/\/ max video width in pixels\n  'minHeight': 480,   \/\/ min video height in pixels\n  'maxHeight': 1280,  \/\/ max video height in pixels,\n  'rotate': 0         \/\/ rotation in degrees possible values: 0,90,-90,180\n},\n```\n* `<dict> scanSettings`: override scan settings - see `set_scanSettings(...)` method for more information,\n* `<dict> stabilizationSettings`: override tracking stabilization settings - see `set_stabilizationSettings(...)` method for more information,\n* `[<objects>] NNs` or `[<string>] NNsPaths`: trained neural networks models in use,\n* `<boolean> followZRot`: If the neural network detection window should rotate to better track the hand. Default is `true`,\n* `<boolean> freeZRot`: If the initial rotation value of the detection window should vary or not. If set to `false`, we will only detect hands vertically aligned. Default is `true`.\n\n\nIf the user has a mobile device in portrait display mode, the width and height of these parameters are automatically inverted for the first camera request. If it does not succeed, we invert the width and height.\n\n\n\n\n### Error codes\nThe initialization function ( `callbackReady` in the code snippet ) will be called with an error code ( `errCode` ). It can have these values:\n* `false`: no error occurs,\n* `\"GL_INCOMPATIBLE\"`: WebGL is not available, or this WebGL configuration is not enough (there is no WebGL2, or there is WebGL1 without OES_TEXTURE_FLOAT or OES_TEXTURE_HALF_FLOAT extension),\n* `\"ALREADY_INITIALIZED\"`: the library has been already initialized,\n* `\"NO_CANVASID\"`: no canvas ID was specified,\n* `\"INVALID_CANVASID\"`: cannot found the `<canvas>` element in the DOM,\n* `\"INVALID_CANVASDIMENSIONS\"`: the dimensions `width` and `height` of the canvas are not specified,\n* `\"WEBCAM_UNAVAILABLE\"`: cannot get access to the camera (the user has no camera, or it has not accepted to share the device, or the camera is already busy),\n* `\"GLCONTEXT_LOST\"`: The WebGL context was lost. If the context is lost after the initialization, the `callbackReady` function will be launched a second time with this value as error code,\n\n\n### The returned objects\nWe detail here the arguments of the callback functions like `callbackReady` or `callbackTrack`. The reference of these objects do not change for memory optimization purpose. So you should copy their property values if you want to keep them unchanged outside the callback functions scopes.\n\n#### The initialization returned object\nThe initialization callback function ( `callbackReady` in the code snippet ) is called with a second argument, `spec`, if there is no error. `spec` is a dictionnary having these properties:\n* `GL`: the WebGL context. The rendering 3D engine should use this WebGL context,\n* `canvasElement`: the `<canvas>` element,\n* `videoTexture`: a WebGL texture displaying the camera video. It has the same resolution as the camera video,\n* `[<float>, <float>, <float>, <float>]` videoTransformMat2: flatten 2x2 matrix encoding a scaling and a rotation. We should apply this matrix to viewport coordinates to render `videoTexture` in the viewport,\n* `<HTMLVideoElement> video`: the video used as source for the webgl texture `videoTexture`,\n* `[<string> landmarksLabels]`: the list of the landmark labels. This list depends on the neural network model,\n* `<int> maxHandsDetected`: the maximum number of detected faces.\n\n\n#### The detection state\nAt each render iteration a callback function is executed ( `callbackTrack` in the code snippet ). It has one argument ( `detectState` ) which is a dictionnary with these properties:\n* `<float> detected`: the detection probability, between `0` and `1`,\n* `<float> x`, `<float> y`: The 2D coordinates of the center of the detection frame in the viewport (each between -1 and 1, `x` from left to right and `y` from bottom to top),\n* `<float> s`: the scale along the horizontal axis of the detection frame, between 0 and 1 (1 for the full width). The detection frame is always square,\n* `<float> rx`, `<float> ry`, `<float> rz`: the Euler angles of the head rotation in radians.\n* `<array> landmarks`: `[[<float> x_0, <float> y_0],...,[<float> x_n, <float> y_n]]`: detected landmarks. `x_i` and `y_i` are the relative coordinates of the `i`th landmark in the viewport coordinates (between `-1` and `1`, from left to right and from bottom to top).\n\n\n### Miscellaneous methods\nAfter the initialization (ie after that `callbackReady` is launched ) , these methods are available:\n\n* `WEBARROCKSHAND.resize()`: should be called after resizing the `<canvas>` element to adapt the cut of the video,\n\n* `WEBARROCKSHAND.toggle_pause(<boolean> isPause)`: pause\/resume,\n\n* `WEBARROCKSHAND.set_animateDelay(<integer> delay)`: Change the `animateDelay` (see `init()` arguments),\n\n* `WEBARROCKSHAND.set_inputTexture(<WebGLTexture> tex, <integer> width, <integer> height)`: Change the video input by a WebGL Texture instance. The dimensions of the texture, in pixels, should be provided,\n\n* `WEBARROCKSHAND.reset_inputTexture()`: Come back to the user's video as input texture,\n\n* `WEBARROCKSHAND.get_videoDevices(<function> callback)`: Should be called before the `init` method. 2 arguments are provided to the callback function:\n  * `<array> mediaDevices`: an array with all the devices founds. Each device is a javascript object having a `deviceId` string attribute. This value can be provided to the `init` method to use a specific camera. If an error happens, this value is set to `false`,\n  * `<string> errorLabel`: if an error happens, the label of the error. It can be: `NOTSUPPORTED`, `NODEVICESFOUND` or `PROMISEREJECTED`.\n\n* `WEBARROCKSHAND.set_scanSettings(<object> scanSettings)`: Override scan settings. `scanSettings` is a dictionnary with the following properties:\n  * `<float> threshold`: detection threshold, between `0` and `1`. Default value is `0.97`. You can lower it if you want to make the detection more sensitive (but it will increase the false positive detections),\n  * `<int> nDetectsPerLoop`: specify the number of detection per drawing loop. `0` for adaptative value. Default: `0`\n  * `<int> nScaleLevels`: number of detection steps for the scale. Default: `4`,\n  * `[<float>, <float>, <float>] overlapFactors`: overlap between 2 scan positions for `X`, `Y` and `scale`. Default: `[1.5, 1.5, 2]`,\n\n* `WEBARROCKSHAND.set_stabilizationSettings(<object> stabilizationSettings)`: Override detection stabilization settings. The output of the neural network is always noisy, so we need to stabilize it using a floatting average to avoid shaking artifacts. The internal algorithm computes first a stabilization factor `k` between `0` and `1`. If `k==0.0`, the detection is bad and we favor responsivity against stabilization. It happens when the user is moving quickly, rotating the head or when the detection is bad. On the contrary, if `k` is close to `1`, the detection is nice and the user does not move a lot so we can stabilize a lot. `stabilizationSettings` is a dictionnary with the following properties:\n  * `[<float> minValue, <float> maxValue] qualityFactorRange`: Default value: `[0.9, 0.98]`,\n  * `[<float> minValue, <float> maxValue] alphaRange`: it specify how to apply `k`. Between 2 successive detections, we blend the previous `detectState` values with the current detection values using a mixing factor `alpha`. `alpha=<minValue>` if `k<0.0` and `alpha=<maxValue>` if `k>1.0`. Between the 2 values, the variation is quadratic.\n\n* `WEBARROCKSHAND.update_videoElement(<video> vid, <function|False> callback)`: change the video element used for the detection (which can be provided via `VIDEOSETTINGS.videoElement`) by another video element. A callback function can be called when it is done.\n\n* `WEBARROCKSHAND.update_videoSettings(<object> videoSettings)`: dynamically change the video settings (see [Optionnal init arguments](optionnal-init-arguments) for the properties of `videoSettings`). It is useful to change the camera from the selfie camera (user) to the back (environment) camera. A `Promise` is returned.\n\n* `WEBARROCKSHAND.destroy()`: Clear both graphic memory and JavaScript memory, uninit the library. After that you need to init the library again. A `Promise` is returned.\n\n\n### Using module\n`\/dist\/HandTracker.module.js` is exactly the same as `\/dist\/WebARRocksHand.js` except that it works as a JavaScript module, so you can import it directly using:\n\n```javascript\nimport 'dist\/HandTracker.module.js'\n```\n\nor using `require`.\n\n\n## Virtual Try-on and object manipulation\nVirtual try-on (VTO) and object manipulation demos are provided in this repository.\nThey rely on the [THREE.js VTO helper](\/helpers\/HandTrackerVTOThreeHelper.js) to instantiate THREE.js objects and especially the scene, the camera and the 3D object tracking specific parts of the hand (the *tracker* ).\n\nThe *tracker* can follow the wrist for wrist watch or bracelet VTO, or the palm for object manipulation. The 3D mesh of the bracelet will be imported and added as a child of the tracker in the specific demo script.\n\nThere are 2 `<canvas>` elements overlaid in the DOM:\n\n* The canvas used by `WEBARROCKSHAND` and to display the video. This canvas is below,\n* The canvas used by THREE.js to render the scene.\n\nTo correctly set the position of the 3D mesh, you can open [dev\/models3D\/handWithPlaceholders.blend](\/dev\/models3D\/handWithPlaceholders.blend) using [Blender](https:\/\/blender.org). The place holders are displayed in red and the occluder in white.\nYou can then import your own mesh, scale, rotate and translate it to match the right position, then apply scale rotation and offset and re-export it.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src='dev\/screenshots\/blender0.png' width=\"600\"\/>\n<\/p>\n\nAnother solution consist in reporting the scale, position and rotation in the `demo.js` file and apply them with THREE.js.\n\nThe occluders are 3D meshes rendered with a transparent color. They mask part of the tracking object that are normally masked by the user's hand (the interior of a bracelet for example).\n\n\n\n## Hosting\n\nYou should host the content of this repository using a HTTPS static server.\n\nBe careful to enable gzip HTTP\/HTTPS compression for JSON and JS files. Indeed, the .JSON neuron networks files are quite heavy, but very well compressed with GZIP. You can check the gzip compression of your server [here](https:\/\/checkgzipcompression.com\/).\n\nNeuron network files are loaded through `XMLHttpRequest` after calling `WEBARROCKSHAND.init()`. This loading is proceeded after the user has accepted to share its camera. So we won't load this quite heavy file if the user refuses to share it or if there is no camera available. The loading can be faster if you systematically preload the neural network files using a service worker or a simple raw `XMLHttpRequest` just after the HTML page loading. Then the file will be already in the browser cache when the library will request it.\n\nSome directories of the latest version of this library are hosted on `https:\/\/cdn.webar.rocks\/hand\/` and served through a content delivery network (CDN):\n\n* [\/dist](\/dist\/)\n* [\/helpers](\/helpers\/)\n* [\/neuralNets](\/neuralNets\/)\n\n\n## About the tech\n\n### Under the hood\n\nThis libray uses [WebAR.rocks](https:\/\/webar.rocks) WebGL Deep Learning technology to detect and track the user's hand using a neural network. The accuracy is adaptative: the best is the hardware, the more detections are processed per second. All is done client-side.\n\n### Compatibility\n\n* If `WebGL2` is available, it uses `WebGL2` and no specific extension is required,\n* If `WebGL2` is not available but `WebGL1`, we require either `OES_TEXTURE_FLOAT` extension or `OES_TEXTURE_HALF_FLOAT` extension,\n* If `WebGL2` is not available, and if `WebGL1` is not available or neither `OES_TEXTURE_FLOAT` or `OES_HALF_TEXTURE_FLOAT` are implemented, the user is not compatible.\n\nIf `WebGL2` implementation is lame (like with IOS < 13.3.1), we will force the use of `WebGL1`.\n\nIf a compatibility error is triggered, please post an issue on this repository. If this is a problem with the camera access, please first retry after closing all applications which could use your device (Skype, Messenger, other browser tabs and windows, ...). Please include:\n* a screenshot of [webglreport.com - WebGL1](http:\/\/webglreport.com\/?v=1) (about your `WebGL1` implementation),\n* a screenshot of [webglreport.com - WebGL2](http:\/\/webglreport.com\/?v=2) (about your `WebGL2` implementation),\n* the log from the web console,\n* the steps to reproduce the bug, and screenshots.\n\nDon't panic if you see errors and warning at initialization in the web console. Indeed, we always test all WebGL capabilities. These errors are caught.\n\n\n## License\n\nThis code repository is dual licensed. You have to choose between these 2 licenses:\n\n1.

PHOTO: A chiseled, statuesque man wearing the COOLEST SUPER       HERO SUIT IMAGINABLE, COMPLETE WITH FLOWING CAPE, shines a       confident smile at the lens. This is UBERMAN, champion of       METRO CITY.              \"UBERMAN DEFEATS MASTER MIND'S GIANT ROBOT!\"              PHOTO: Wide-shot of Uberman in mid-flight lifting the GIANT       ROBOT in the sky above the city buildings.              \"MASTER MIND ALL WET AFTER UBERMAN FOILS AQUARIUM HEIST!\"              PHOTO: Uberman stands knee-deep in water. He has his enemy by       the collar. The villain blocks his face from the shot with a       METALLIC GAUNTLET.              The images start to flash by even quicker, each showing the       MYSTERIOUS VILLAIN in various stages of humiliation. In each       photograph he successfully blocks his face with his armored       glove.              We ZOOM IN to the last headline.              \"MASTER MIND BEHIND BARS ONCE AGAIN - THANKS TO UBERMAN!\"              PHOTO: Uberman stands in a gallant pose with his fists on his       hips, obviously trying to accentuate the \"U\" insignia on his       chest.              END OF CREDITS SEQUENCE              EXT. BUILDING - DAY              We DISSOLVE from the photograph to Uberman standing in the       exact same position.              WE PULL BACK showing him atop a BUILDING overlooking the city       below. A perfect view for our guardian hero.              He watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as       people happily go about their day.              Yet, we can't help but detect a hint of sadness in Uberman's       expression.                                                                2.                                                UBERMAN                 You look so peaceful from up here.              His serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud BEEPING SOUND       coming from his wrist.              He looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one) on his right arm.       It's a silver band with a FLASHING red letter \"U\".                                  UBERMAN (CONT'D)                 Looks like Roxanne's in trouble                 again.              Uberman leaps off the building and into the air. His cape       gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off       into the distance like a speeding bullet.              EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT              Grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned       building overlooking the COAST. Once a place of knowledge and       wonder - now home to a great evil.              INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              The inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge       hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC       EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have       an obvious function FLASH and HUM.              A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story       MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS       INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM-       SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP.              He's dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain       could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE       WITH A GIANT GREEN \"M\" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging       at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES       PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES.              Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO       PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS.              A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other       men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI.       The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board,       is dressed as the philosopher PLATO.                                  EINSTEIN                 I hate the outfits. I mean, I get                 it: we're all supposed to be                 \"masterminds\" - very clever.                           (MORE)                                                                 3.                           EINSTEIN(cont'd)                 I just feel stupid. I mean, what                 the hell did Einstein really do                 anyway?                                  PLATO                 Theory of relativity.              Einstein starts feverishly scratching his side.                                  EINSTEIN                 Well, you'd think he'd invent a                 wool sweater that didn't itch so                 much.              Da Vinci and Plato's eyes suddenly grow with concern as they       see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein.              Einstein notices his colleague's staring over his right       shoulder and turns around.              He turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with       his metal gauntlet.                                  MASTER MIND                 The real Einstein once said, \"God                 does not play dice with the world.\"                 He was right, because the world is                 MY dice. Is that understood?                                  DA VINCI &amp; PLATO                 Sir! Yes, sir!                                  EINSTEIN                     (gasping for air)                 Yes, sir.              Master Mind undoes his grip on Einstein's throat.                                  MASTER MIND                 Alright, then - clean slate. Do we                 have the girl?                                  DA VINCI                 Yes, sir. She fell into our trap                 just like you knew she would.                                  MASTER MIND                 Reporters are a curious lot, and                 easily manipulated.              He quickly checks his physique in a GIANT MIRROR, adjusts his       posture and sucks in his gut.                                                                   4.                                                MASTER MIND                 Alright, let's not keep the lady                 waiting.              MOMENTS LATER              Da Vinci escorts a BLINDFOLDED and bound woman, ROXANNE       RITCHI, to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are       standing guard over a large BLACK SWIVEL-CHAIR facing away       from us.              She pulls free of Da Vinci's grasp and waits for him to undo       the blindfold.              Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne's striking       features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes       that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Miss Ritchi, we meet again.              The chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master       Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 You didn't need to turn around like                 that. I can recognize the stench of                 failure.              Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh.                                  MASTER MIND                 I trust you gentlemen know the very                 sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly                 regarded investigative journalist                 who some say has a more than                 friendly relationship with our                 super powered foe Uberman. And Miss                 Ritchi, I trust you've already met                 my new crew: The Mad Geniuses!              Roxanne gives Einstein a once over.                                  ROXANNE                 Looks like a real group of winners.                 At the risk of sounding cliche',                 you'll never get away with this.                                  MASTER MIND                 In a way, I already have.              Roxanne unleashes an exhausted SIGH.                                                                5.                                                ROXANNE                 We go through this every time. You                 kidnap me to get to Uberman, he                 immediately finds your hideout,                 escapes whatever lame trap you've                 come up with, and takes you and                 your cronies to jail. I propose we                 just save everybody some heartache                 this time by YOU letting me go, and                 ME forgetting this whole thing ever                 happened?

MASTER MIND                 You have a wicked tongue. I hope                 you rid yourself of that when                 you're my queen.              Roxanne unleashes a snort-filled laugh.                                  ROXANNE                 I'm sorry. What makes you think I                 would want to be your queen?                                  MASTER MIND                 Power corrupts absolutely, Miss                 Ritchi. And when I have ultimate                 power over this city, I have                 absolutely every intention of                 corrupting you with it.                                  PLATO                 Sir!              Master Mind turns to Plato who's now standing at a computer       terminal.                                  MASTER MIND                     (annoyed)                 What is it!?              EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman flies toward the Observatory like a rocket.                                                                   6.                                   INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman crashes through the wall to the room we were just in.       He looks around, but there's suddenly NOT A SOUL IN SIGHT.                                                               CUT TO:              EXT.

HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY              Machines, cables and terminals criss-cross the craft's main       bridge. Through the enormous surrounding windows we can see       the observatory shrinking in the distance.              Master Mind watches Uberman on a small TV monitor as the hero       intently searches his hideout.                                  UBERMAN                     (on monitor)                 Master Mind!              INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman throws up his arms in frustration when suddenly -                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Over here, old friend.              He turns to see a FAMILIAR BLUE FACE OF EVIL ON A GIANT       SCREEN.                                   UBERMAN                 What's the matter, miss your old                 jail cell?              Uberman starts walking toward the monitor.                                  MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)                 Actually, I wanted to share the                 experience with my oldest friend.              A MECHANIZED CAGE shoots out of the floor, suddenly trapping       Metro City's protector.              Totally unfazed, our hero stares on.                                                                   7.                                                 UBERMAN                 You can't possibly believe this                 will work.              Master Mind pulls out a SMALL BLACK BOX with a SINGLE RED       BUTTON on it.                                  MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)                 Oh, can't I? I have attained                 control of the Earth's most                 abundant energy source. I doubt                 even you are strong enough to                 withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED                 POWER OF THE SUN!!!              He presses the button.              EXT. OUTER SPACE              A sinister-looking SATELLITE orbits Earth's atmosphere. Its       bay doors suddenly open, deploying two huge SOLAR PANELS.              The panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the       sun. They immediately start GLOWING as they absorb the       burning star's power.              The front of the satellite begins to make a loud HUMMING       SOUND as it prepares to unleash its unholy power.              INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY              From the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from       the observatory.                                  PLATO                 We're now at minimum safe distance,                 master.              Master Mind turns from the CAMERA he was broadcasting on and       puts down the control box.                                  MASTER MIND                 Excellent. Stop here, I like this                 view.                                  PLATO                 Twenty seconds until impact.              Master Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci       and Einstein. She almost appears a little bored.              Disappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the       monitor now showing Uberman trapped in the cage.                                                                8.                                                MASTER MIND                 Any last words?              Uberman looks up at the screen with a cocky smile.                                  UBERMAN (ON MONITOR)                 Yes: there's no caging the power of                 justice.                                  PLATO                 Ten seconds to impact.              On the screen we see Uberman take two of the cage's bars in       his hands. He yanks...NOTHING.                                   PLATO (CONT'D)                 Nine...              Master Mind stares at the monitor, slightly confused.                                   PLATO (CONT'D)                 Eight...              Uberman yanks on the bars again, this time using his foot as       leverage.                                  MASTER MIND                     (genuinely concerned)                 What's going on?                                  UBERMAN                     (straining)                 Hold...on...a second.              Master Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein. They're equally       befuddled at the hero's sudden weakness.                                   PLATO                 Seven...              Uberman loses his grip and FALLS BACKWARD ON HIS ASS.                                  UBERMAN                 SON OF A BITCH!!              Master Mind and the minions all cringe in unison.              Da Vinci turns to Roxanne not believing his ears.                                  DA VINCI                 What did he just say?                                                                9.                                                PLATO                 Six......Five...              Master Mind begins to laugh.                                  MASTER MIND                 What kind of trick is this?              Uberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression.                                  UBERMAN                 Like you don't know. These bars are                 made of copper, aren't they?                                     PLATO                 Four...                                     MASTER MIND                 Yeah, so?              Uberman tries to shield his grief with his hand.                                  UBERMAN                 You figured out my weakness, damn                 you. I CAN'T BEND COPPER!                                     PLATO                 Three...                                  MASTER MIND                 Your weakness is copper?                                     PLATO                 Two...one.              Everyone turns to the window.              EXT. OUTER SPACE              The satellite fires a giant BEAM OF LIGHT toward the earth.              EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              The beam hits the observatory. The building instantly       EXPLODES in a white nova blast of fire.              INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY              The blast is so bright everyone turns away from the window.       Then, as suddenly as it began, the awesome light dies out.              One by one, the passengers unshield their eyes and look out       toward the observatory.                                                                 10.                            All we can see through the haze of destruction is fire and       smoke.                                  PLATO                 I don't think even he could have                 survived that.              Einstein suddenly turns giddy with excitement.                                  EINSTEIN                 Whoa! Is it me or did you just                 finally destroy Uberman?                                   MASTER MIND                     (carefully skeptical)                 Well...let's not get ahead of                 ourselves.              Da Vinci suddenly sees something outside.                                  DA VINCI                 Look, there's something in the sky,                 coming this way.                                   ROXANNE                 Uberman!              Master Mind turns toward the window.              An object is in the air, flying directly toward them. As it       closes in we can just make out the FAMILIAR OUTLINE OF A       CAPPED FIGURE.                                  MASTER MIND                 I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HE'S                 GONNA RAM US!!!              Everyone scatters and braces themselves for the impact.              Master Mind, seeing all the good places taken, doesn't know       what to do with himself. He just covers his giant head with       his hands.              The figure CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and lands at his feet.              He looks down to see a CHARRED BLACK HUMAN SKELETON. Around       its neck is the unmistakable black cape of Uberman.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                     (horrified)                 HOLY SHIT!                                                               11.                            Roxanne breaks out of Da Vinci's hold and runs over to the       body.                                   ROXANNE                 Uberman?              She stares down at the still smoking corpse, the tattered       black cape with the yellow \"U\" on it.              Roxanne turns to Master Mind, who's still visibly dumbfounded       at the grotesque sight before him.                                  ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 You killed him!              Roxanne's eyes roll back. Da Vinci catches her from behind as       she FAINTS.              Einstein turns to Master Mind, looking at him as if he's just       walked on water.                                  EINSTEIN                 You did it!              Now that he's committed the impossible - our villain is at a       complete loss.                                  MASTER MIND                 ...so I did.                                  EINSTEIN                 I mean, I know you always wanted                 to. I mean, all the schemes all the                 plots - I never thought you'd                 actually be capable of it.              Giddy as a school girl, Einstein turns to his fellow       henchmen.                                  EINSTEIN                 This is history. Every villain and                 lackey in the history of villains                 and lackeys dream of this moment,                 but when does it actually EVER                 happen?              A sudden realization comes over his face.                                  EINSTEIN                 Good lord...You do all realize what                 we get to do now, don't you?                                                                  12.                            His question is met with acquisitive looks from Master Mind       and the others.                                  EINSTEIN                 We get to go on a crime wave.              CRIME WAVE MONTAGE - SET TO \"Fun Fun Fun\" by The Beach Boys.              SPINNING HEADLINE: \"UBERMAN'S DEATH IGNITES CITY WIDE CRIME       WAVE!\"              ARMORED TRUCK              It's driving along when the men inside suddenly notice       something - THEY'RE FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE CITY STREETS.              We PULL BACK to see the truck being carried by a giant claw       at the bottom of a BRAIN COPTER.              Inside the cockpit Master Mind and his henchmen laugh       maniacally.              SPINNING HEADLINE: \"CHAMPION-LESS CITY AT THE MERCY OF       HOOLIGANS.\"              METRO CITY BANK              Da Vinci and Einstein run out the front of the bank holding       BAGS OF MONEY.              Two beat officers see them and take chase after them around       the corner and into an alley.              After a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming       and running for their lives as a GIANT ROBOT CHASES after       them.              The robot stops, then suddenly it's head opens up like       convertible car top with Master Mind and Plato at the       driver's wheel.              They smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done.              SPINNING HEADLINE: \"MASTER MIND BLACKMAILS METRO!!!\"              A VICIOUS TORNADO              It's heading for downtown Metro as Master Mind and the       lackeys coolly look on.              Three large DUMP TRUCKS pull up, filled to the brim with       bricks of CASH.                                                               13.                            The DRIVERS jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in       the three trucks.              Master Mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one       when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward       the tornado.                                   MASTER MIND                     (absentmindedly)                 Oh, right.              Master Mind pulls a television REMOTE from his pocket and       aims it at approaching windstorm of death.              He presses the button marked \"Tornado Off.\"              The tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the       city.              As they drive through the city streets, Master stares out the       window with a hint of something in his eyes. Is it       melancholy?              END OF MONTAGE              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              It's Metro City's premier bowling alley. On top of the neon       lit building is a GIANT 30 FOOT TALL CEMENT BOWLING BALL.              INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              HAL STEWART (early 30's) takes careful aim with his BOWLING       BALL.                                  HAL                 It's a sport of honor, focus and                 grace. Honor the ball, focus on the                 pins, release the ball not hard and                 fast, but as if you were releasing                 a baby dove.              He takes a step, pulls back his arm, and releases the ball,       following it with his eyes.              It's a horrible shot - INSTANT GUTTER BALL.              An aged barmaid type with a cigarette hanging from her mouth       looks over at him.                                  HAL                 Okay, do something like that - but                 center it more.                                                                 14.

It's lookin'                 REAL good.              It doesn't get anymore clear. This man is a pig.                                  VINNIE (O.S.)

VINNIE                 You're fired. Leave your shirt and                 locker key.              This bit of news hits Hal like a freight train.                                  HAL                 Fired? Are you going to tell me                 why?                                  VINNIE                 Showing up to work late. Showing up                 to work late drunk. Sexually                 harassing customers. Stealing from                 the register.                                  HAL                 Vinnie, I don't know where you're                 getting these accusations -              Vinnie takes out a video tape from his desk drawer and puts       in a VCR.                                                               15.                                                    HAL                    Oh, which one do you supposedly                    have here?                                     VINNIE                    This is all of them at once.              TELEVISION              A WOMAN walks up to a BOWLING EMPLOYEE and hands him a pair       of shoes.              As the employee turns to the wall of shoes, a very drunk and       disheveled Hal comes running in and pushes him aside.                                     HAL                    I've got this one, Benny. So,                    Cinderella. Can I help you find                    your glass slipper?                                     WOMAN                    Yeah, I'm looking for a seven.              He folds his arms on the counter and leans into her with a       cat-like grin on his face.                                     HAL                        (with a leer)                    Seven - Well, maybe I could                    interest you in something in an                    EIGHT. Namely, me.              Disgusted, she walks off screen.                                     HAL                    Lesbo.              Suddenly realizing the register's open, he quickly grabs a       stack of cash and shoves it in his pocket.              BACK TO OFFICE              Vinnie turns off the television and waits for Hal to respond.                                     HAL                    From the angle of the camera, I can                    see where you might have gotten the                    wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don't                    think you've thought this through.                    If you fire me, who's gonna be                    captain of the alley's bowling                    team?                                                                 16.                                                VINNIE                 Um, I don't know. Maybe somebody                 who can actually bowl. You guys                 have never won a game. I hired you                 because you said you were on the                 pro circuit.                                  HAL                 No, I said I WILL BE on the pro                 circuit.                                  VINNIE                 Please, a loser like you will never                 amount to anything.              This harsh remark seems to leave Hal genuinely stunned.                                  HAL                 Wow...If that's how you feel...I                 guess we should then talk about                 what kind of severance I'm gonna                 get.              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              TWO BRUISERS open the door and throw Hal out onto the street.              He quickly picks himself up and turns back toward the       building.                                  HAL                 Hey...what about my ball?              A bowling ball sails past him, just missing his head.                                     HAL                 Thank-you!              EXT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - DAY              The massive building with a giant 7 on the roof stands in the       heart of Metro City.              INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY              The cubicles and offices are alive with the hustle and bustle       of a busy news day.              Phones are RINGING, REPORTERS are TALKING, and Editors are       SHOUTING.              The elevator doors open and out steps Roxanne Ritchi.                                                               17.                            Everything stops as the entire office suddenly falls SILENT.              Somewhat taken aback by the reaction, Roxanne scans the room       to see every eye on her.                                  ROXANNE                 It's...um...It's good to be back.                 Thanks for everyone's cards and                 concerns. I really appreciated it -                 now I'm ready to climb back on the                 horse.              No one is budging - their looks of pity are really starting       to make her uncomfortable.              The back office door suddenly opens and out comes FRANK       BONIN, the gruff, middle-aged Producer of Channel 7 News.              Noticing the silence, he looks up and sees the sad       expressions on everybody's face.                                  FRANK                 Someone die or something?              He suddenly notices Roxanne - both feet are placed firmly in       his mouth.                                   FRANK                     (cursing himself)                 Oh, Jesus.                                     ROXANNE                 It's okay.              Frank quickly walks up to Roxanne and takes her gently by the       arm.                                  FRANK                 Come on into my office, sweetie.              INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS              He sits her down on his leather couch, then quickly turns       toward his door.                                  FRANK                 Can we get this woman some water                 for God's sake?                     (to Rebecca)                 I gave you two months off. What're                 you doing back? People are gonna                 think I'm a slave driver.                                                               18.                                                ROXANNE                 Aren't you?                                  FRANK                 Yeah, but I don't want people to                 think it.                                  ROXANNE                 Frank, listen. I want to go back to                 work. I NEED to go back to work.                                  FRANK                 ...You're hysterical, aren't you?              Frank sits down on the couch and blankets Roxanne with A WARM       EMBRACE.                                  ROXANNE                 What're you doing?                                  FRANK                 Keeping you warm before you go into                 shock.                     (toward the open door)                 DO I HAVE SLICE OPEN A CAMEL HUMP                 TO GET A GLASS OF WATER AROUND                 HERE?              A SECRETARY quickly enters with a bottled water. She sets it       on the table in front of them and leaves.              Roxanne pulls herself out of Frank's grasp and stands up to       face him.                                  ROXANNE                 It was a traumatic experience. Yes,                 everyone knows Uberman and me                 were...close. But what I really                 need - what would really make me                 better is getting back to work.              There's a sudden awkward silence from Frank.                                  FRANK                 Well, that's going to be...                                  ROXANNE                 I thought you'd be happy to have me                 back.                                             19.                                      FRANK       Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us       happier than to have our girl back,       but...                         ROXANNE       Yes?                        FRANK       Things have sorta...changed.                        ROXANNE       In three weeks?                        FRANK       Listen, I'm not one who likes to       open up wounds - especially ones       that are just starting to scab, but       you were sorta our go to girl for       the exclusive on Uberman. And now       that he's gone...I moved Brad into       your anchor spot.                        ROXANNE           (disgusted)       Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an       idiot.                        FRANK       It's the suits. They think it's       time to switch things up.                        ROXANNE       Oh, because they can't use me to       get the big story.                        FRANK       C'mon, Roxie. Using is in the       nature of what we do. They used       you, you used Uberman. Everybody's       happy.                        ROXANNE           (defensive)       I didn't use him.                        FRANK       Oh, I didn't mean that. I know you       two were in love or something. My       bad.                         ROXANNE       We were.                                                                  20.                                                FRANK                 And that's great.                                  ROXANNE                 Very in love.              There's a hind of self-doubt in Roxanne's expression, as if       she's failed to convince even herself of this.                                  ROXANNE                 Okay. So, where are they going to                 move me if Brad has my spot?                                  FRANK                 ...Human interest.                                  ROXANNE                 Bake sales and pet stories.                                  FRANK                 I told them I wouldn't be surprised                 if you just upped and quit. You                 busted your ass for that desk.              Roxanne can hardly get it out - she's busy swallowing her       pride                                  ROXANNE                 I'll take it.              Frank looks up at her, not believing what he's hearing.                                  FRANK                 What?              EXT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Amongst the jungle of high rises, one small building stands       out from the rest - A tiny, forgotten piece of 19th century       Gothic architecture.

ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              A mixture of old and new. Dusty Victorian furniture and       dilapidated bookshelves sit side by side with pristinely       futuristic machinery.              The building has been converted into Master Mind's new SECRET       LAIR.                                                               21.                            In the center of the main room is a three storey tall GLOWING       BLUE ORB. At the base of it is a sign that reads \"Reactor -       Don't Touch.\"              We PAN OVER to the READING ROOM where Master Mind is sitting       on a couch watching TELEVISION.                                  REPORTER ON TELEVISION (O.S.)                 It's been nearly six weeks, and                 still no word on the whereabouts of                 billionaire playboy, and                 philanthropist, Wayne Scott. Tune                 in at 11:00 as we look into what                 has become Metro City's biggest                 mystery.                                  TELEVISION NARRATOR (O.S.)                 We now return to \"The Hero of our                 Hearts: The Uberman story.\"              Einstein and Plato come into the room holding a BAG OF LOOT.                                  EINSTEIN                 Just robbed the diamond exchange.                                  MASTER MIND                     (feigning pleasure)                 Great, great. Put it on the pile.              Einstein tosses it on a LARGE PILE of purloined valuables in       the corner of the room.                                  EINSTEIN                 Anything else today?                                  MASTER MIND                 No.              Master Mind turns his attention back to the screen. Plato       sees that Master Mind is in a funk and tries to snap him out       of it.                                  PLATO                     (cheerfully)                 Sir, the new reactor is installed.              Plato nods to the giant orb.                                  PLATO                 Do you want to throw the switch? I                 know how you love to start                 reactors.                                                                  22.                                                MASTER MIND                 Maybe later.              Einstein gives Master Mind a funny look then exchanges       glances with Plato before leaving the two of them alone.              Without turning away from the TV, Master Mind addresses       Plato.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 What is it, Plato?                                  PLATO                     (nervously)                 Sir, I can't help but notice that                 you've been...a little down lately.                                  MASTER MIND                 When I want your opinion I'll beat                 it out of you.                                  PLATO                 Yes, sir, I know, but please                 forgive my impertinence. It's just                 that you seem to have lost your                 lust for our profession. You've                 stopped going on jobs and spend                 most of your time watching Uberman                 specials.              Master Mind relaxes slightly and turns to face the window in       a classically contemplative pose. After an overdramatic       beat...                                  MASTER MIND                 I have defeated my greatest enemy.                 I have free reign over Metro City.                 I have more wealth than a thousand                 Sultans. I've achieved all I have                 worked for...so why am I so                 unhappy?              He walks over to a PAINTED PORTRAIT that looks almost exactly       like him, except slightly older, maybe meaner - MASTER MIND'S       FATHER.                                  MASTER MIND                 I mean, my father, god rest his                 evil and tormented soul, raised me                 straight from the test tube to be a                 symbol of evil.                           (MORE)                                                               23.                           MASTER MIND(cont'd)                 And, I have accomplished something                 he had only dreamed about - the                 destruction of Metro City's                 champion. I tell you, I've always                 lived with this unquenchable                 thirst. I thought it was to make                 him proud or to get absolute power.                 But now that I've pretty much                 accomplished both, I am at a loss.                                  PLATO                 ...I sort of have a theory about                 all that.                                  MASTER MIND                     (snippy)                 Oh, really?                                  PLATO                 Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman                 was more important to you than you                 thought.                                  MASTER MIND                 He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I                 wonder, did he consider me his evil                 equal or was I just an annoying,                 little gnat to him? ...What's the                 second part?                                  PLATO                 I think you sort of have a thing                 for Roxanne Ritchi.              Master Mind quickly takes his lackey by the throat.                                  MASTER MIND                 YOU WORM! HOW DARE YOU! WHERE WOULD                 YOU GET SUCH A NOTION?                                  PLATO                 Sir, your plans always involve Ms.                 Ritchi either being kidnapped or                 placed in danger. If that's not                 love, I don't know what is. It's                 the grown up equivalent of dipping                 her pigtails in the ink well. Don't                 you see? She's the one treasure                 that's always escaped you.              From Master Mind's expression, we see Plato's words beginning       to ring true.                                                                  24.                            INT. RESTURAUNT - DAY              Roxanne is having lunch with several girlfriends sitting       around her, gabbing.                                  FRIEND #1                 I can't believe you came back so                 soon.                                  FRIEND #2                 Are you sure it's not TOO SOON,                 honey?                                  ROXANNE                 I just wanted to get back to work.                                  FRIEND #3                 What we need to do is get you back                 on the saddle...the love saddle.              Friend 1 and 2 give 3 disapproving looks.                                  FRIEND #3                 It's been three weeks.                                  FRIEND #2                 She just lost the love of her life,                 Grace.              A WAITER comes by with a tray of CAESAR SALADS and begins       setting them out for the ladies.                                  ROXANNE                 I keep trying to tell people it                 wasn't really like that. Uberman                 and I - We were kinda having                 problems. We broke up.              The waiter ALMOST DROPS HIS TRAY AT THIS. The women are too       shocked by Roxanne's revelation to notice.                                  FRIEND #1                 You broke up with Uberman!                                  FRIEND #3                 You must have REALLY, REALLY high                 standards. I mean, you were dating                 a god. I mean, what's it take?                                  ROXANNE                 Maybe someone who's a little more                 aware of his faults. Someone a                 little more sensitive.                                                                  25.                                                FRIEND #3                 Right. Someone who listens, sexy                 but attainable with cute little                 cheeks like a hamster and                 heartbreak in his eyes.              She turns to Friend one and two to explain.                                  FRIEND #3                 She wants John Cusack.                                     FRIEND #2                 The actor?                                  FRIEND #3                 No, the famous pediatrist - Yes,                 the actor. Ever since we were                 teenagers, Roxanne's totally had                 the hots for him.                                  ROXANNE                 Well, until he miraculously comes                 walking into my life, I'm just                 going to take a little reflection                 time for myself.              The waiter gets a confused look on his face then slips away       as Roxanne and her friends continue to chat away.              EXT. RESTURAUNT - DAY              The waiter tosses his apron in a trash can, then rolls up his       sleeve and presses A STRANGE LOOKING DEVICE STRAPPED TO HIS       WRIST.              His image gets staticy, like a TV station going out, then       disappears - revealing the man's true form underneath: MASTER       MIND!                                  MASTER MIND                 Who the hell is John Cusack?              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              A YOUNG MOTHER pushes her baby stroller past a building       construction site.              ACROSS THE STREET              A local POLITICIAN addresses a group of REPORTERS on the       sidewalk, including Roxanne.                                                                  26.                                                POLITICIAN                 The Fifth Avenue Renovation                 Project, which I championed, will                 breath new life into the downtown                 area. New life means new jobs and                 new revenue.                                  ROXANNE                 Councilman, is it true that your                 brother-in-law's construction                 company won the contract for this                 project?                                  POLITICIAN                 Well...er...yes, but...look I'm not                 here to answer a lot of crazy                 questions...              YOUNG MOTHER              The young mother stops halfway down the block, reaches into       the stroller and tries to comfort her now crying baby.              Above her, a CRANE is maneuvering a pile of STEEL GIRDERS to       an upper floor.              Hal comes around the corner and heads in her direction.              CRANE              The crane GRINDS TO A HALT. The OPERATOR has a confused look       on his face as he moves levers back and forth in an effort to       fix the problem.              Hal stops a few feet from the woman and stoops down to tie       his shoe.              CRANE              The operator's hand slips off the lever, hitting a RED       BUTTON. To his horror the crane DROPS ITS LOAD OF STEEL.              HAL AND THE WOMAN              The woman looks up to see the girders seconds from crushing       her and her baby. She screams.              Hal looks up and sees it as well. He starts to run out of the       way and crashes into the woman and stroller.              ACROSS THE STREET                                                                  27.                            The reporters turns their cameras just in time to catch on       film what appears to be Hal pushing the woman to safety just       as the GIRDERS CRASH TO THE GROUND.              HAL AND MOTHER              Tears of joy in her eyes, the woman picks up her baby and       kisses it.              Hal struggles to catch his breath as the mother turns to him.                                  YOUNG MOTHER                 Thank you! Thank you for saving me                 and my baby!              She hugs him with her free arm, weeping with joy.                                     HAL                        (not knowing what she's                         talking about)                 Huh?              He's a little uncomfortable with the woman's public display       of affection and the small child in-between their embrace.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 There, there.              Hal slowly eases out of the woman's grip.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Okay, we better...well, I hear                 these little guys smother easy.              The reporters rush over and surround Hal and the mother.                                  ROXANNE                 What's it feel like to be a hero?              Hal looks up at Roxanne. Instantly, he's captivated by her       beauty.                                  HAL                 Well...I'm just a man doing what                 men do. You're Roxanne Ritchi,                 aren't you?              They're suddenly interrupted when another reporter pushes his       way in between them.                                  REPORTER                 Were you scared?                                                               28.                                                   HAL                    Scared? Who had time?              The reporters eat this up.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT              TELEVISION              John Cusack stands in the rain looking up at a window of a       two story house. He holds up a BOOMBOX and \"In Your Eyes\" by       Peter Gabriel begins to play.              From the couch, Master Mind and his minions watch.                                     MASTER MIND                    John Cusack, huh? So all I have to                    do is have a cute puppy dog stare,                    be willing to make a fool of myself                    and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS.              He turns to see Da Vinci watching the movie and wiping a tear       from his cheek.                                     MASTER MIND                    Please, get a hold of yourself.              INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT              Roxanne is carrying a large paper coffee cup in her hands as       she peruses the isles. She sets it down on a shelf to pull a       book out and ends up KNOCKING THE DRINK OVER.                                     ROXANNE                    Shit.              She goes to pick it up when someone bends down and picks it       up for her.              Looking up to thank him, Roxanne is suddenly stunned       speechless - It's popular and critically acclaimed actor JOHN       CUSACK, or rather Master Mind disguised as him.                                     \"JOHN CUSACK\"                    Oh the humanity - it was a Venti.                                     ROXANNE                        (stunned)                    You're...you're.                                     \"JOHN CUSACK\"                    Yes, it's me. John Cusack...the                    actor.                                                                29.                            He notices the book she's reading.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Hey, is that Shelly? Wait, I think                 remember something from that one -                 Let's see: \"My head is screaming `I                 want you and need you' - my heart                 it keeps reaching to see you and                 feel you - yet in the end, I'm                 alone once again.\" Wow, I scare                 even myself. I'm sorry. I'm just                 really into poetry. Probably                 because I'm so sensitive and always                 going to great lengths to express                 myself. But enough about me. Can I                 fill you up?                                  ROXANNE                     (captivated)                 ...Yes.

ROXANNE                 Right.              INT. BOOKSTORE CAFE' - LATER              Roxanne talks as John Cusack listens to her every word       intently.                                  ROXANNE                 I did have a boyfriend - until                 fairly recently.              She suddenly begins to feel the stares around her as passers-       by being to notice who she's with.                                  ROXANNE                 I'm sorry - this is so surreal!                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Yeah, they charge way too much at                 these places - Now back to your                 boyfriend. I'm interested and                 compassionate. I want to know about                 you.                                                               30.                                                ROXANNE                 Things were complicated. He was a                 man married to his work. There                 was...there was a lot of                 competition in his line of                 business. I'm sure you know what                 that's like.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Sure. In my business, one thing I                 have is RIVALS.

ROXANNE                 ...The body-builder who used to                 play The Hulk on TV?                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Did he? Well, we're always up for                 the same roles. Did your boyfriend                 have someone like that? A                 particular rival that was always                 getting his goat - so to speak?                                  ROXANNE                 Well...one rival in particular                 seemed to get more of his attention                 than I ever did. But enough about                 my problems.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 NO, TELL ME MORE!!!              Suddenly realizing his outburst, he begins COUGHING to mask       it.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\" (CONT'D)                 I'm sorry. I got a whooping cough.                 Had it ever since Serendipity. I                 WONDER WHERE OUR REFILLS ARE!!!                 (fakes cough) See, there it goes                 again. Please, go on.                                  ROXANNE                 Right, well, he seemed to need him                 more than he needed me.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 How do you mean?                                                                31.                                                ROXANNE                 It was conflict he thrived on. He                 always said he wouldn't know what                 to do with himself if Master - I                 mean, this guy were gone. It was                 like he needed it, like oxygen.              The answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of       lightening. He turns away from her as if for private time.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                     (almost to himself)                 I think I finally understand...The                 only logical answer is to recreate                 that rivalry - or if that's                 impossible, create one of equal                 structure. That's it!                                  ROXANNE                 What?              John Cusack snaps out of his dream-like haze realizing she's       heard every word.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing                 for a part...where I play a man who                 talks to himself at inappropriate                 times.              In a sudden rush, he rises out of his chair.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 I have to go right now, but I'd                 really like to see you again - if                 that's alright.              Roxanne looks up at him - She can't help but laugh at the       craziness of the situation.                                  ROXANNE                 I'd love that.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY              Master storms in the office to find Plato and Einstein       playing darts with the original Mona Lisa.                                  EINSTEIN                 Got her nose!                                  MASTER MIND                 I've got it!                                                                  32.                            Everyone stops what they're doing upon seeing that their       master has returned.                                  MASTER MIND                 I've got it!                                  MASTER MIND                 It's plain and simple.                 Extraordinary minds need                 extraordinary stimulation. Without                 that stimulus they wither and die.                 Therefore, there is only one                 logical conclusion: I must create a                 new superhero.                                  EINSTEIN                 Yeah, maybe that's not such hot                 idea...                                  MASTER MIND                     (ignoring him)                 Prepare for Operation Superhero                 Genesis!              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY              The lab is slick, white and ultra modern.              Dressed in a lab coat, Master Mind enters through a SLIDING       GLASS DOOR rubbing his hands excitedly.                                  MASTER MIND                 Prepare the subject.              He glances down into a large HOLE in the floor to see a naked       thirty year old man, SEVERS, shivering. Above the hole, a       huge vat dangles precariously.              Master Mind steps behind a glass partition next to Plato and       Einstein.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Plato, pour the toxic waste.              Plato throws a switch causing the vat to tip hundreds of       gallons of green and brown goo into the hole.                                    MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Drainage.              The slime is sucked out through the floor, leaving a goo-       soaked Severs.                                                                 33.                            Master Mind looks into the pit.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Well, Severs?                                  SEVERS                 I feel fine. Just a little sticky,                 but aside from that everything's                 completely -              BOOM - Severs explodes. A hail of blood and tissue covers       Master Mind and his men. For a good ten seconds nobody moves       an inch. Finally...                                     MASTER MIND                 Okay then.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - LABORATORY - DAY              Through a glass WATER TANK we see a man breathing normally.

MASTER MIND                 Ah. Does he have extraordinary                 strength?                                     PLATO                 Well...no.

ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY              The next guinea-pig, STENWICK, is standing in a sealed glass       tube not much wider than himself.                                  MASTER MIND                 Plato, the radioactive spider,                 please.              Plato throws the switch DROPPING A SINGLE SPIDER onto       Stenwick's arm.              Stenwick looks and winces as it bites him.                                  STENWICK                 Ow!              He brushes the spider off.

STENWICK                     (shaken)                 No. Ah...sir, I didn't know this                 was about spiders. I have a pretty                 severe case of arachnophobia.              Master Mind thinks for a moment, then turns to Plato.                                  MASTER MIND                 We're gonna need more venom.              Plato throws another switch, this time DUMPING THOUSANDS OF       SPIDERS on poor Stenwick. His SCREAMS begin to fade as he's       engulfed with swarms of crawling arachnids.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 How `bout now, Stenwick?                 ....Stenwick?              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY              Master Mind is pacing back and forth. The muted TV plays in       the background.                                   MASTER MIND                 This has proven to be a challenge.                 I just don't know what I want. What                 do I want?                                                                 35.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 I want a man of moral fiber with a                 strong sense of right and wrong.                 Someone who doesn't seek power -                 instead, they must have it thrust                 upon them and find, within                 themselves, the courage to rise to                 the occasion.              Einstein lets out a short laugh, getting everyone's       attention.                                  EINSTEIN                 Yeah, well, it sounds like what you                 want is Uberman.              Master Mind snaps the fingers of his non-metal hand.                                  MASTER MIND                 That's it! Why make a copy when the                 real thing will do?              The lackeys look at each other, they can't believe what       they're hearing.                                  EINSTEIN                 I was just kidding, sir. In case                 you forgot, you actually burned                 Uberman alive.                                  MASTER MIND                 Then we'll make a new one. Plato,                 bring me the box!              MINUTES LATER              Master Mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small       table.              Plato places a STAINLESS STEEL CHEST in the tables center.              As Master Mind opens it, he's immediately doused in WHITE       GLOW emanating from inside.                                  MASTER MIND                 Behold - Uberessence. The very                 thing that gave Uberman his                 superhuman powers.                                                               36.

MASTER MIND                 Oh, I shot him with a power sucking                 gun and had this idea to use this                 to clone a whole army of evil                 Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never                 got around to following up with                 that.                                  PLATO                 I believe he defeated you before                 you could, master.                                  MASTER MIND                 ...Right. Man, he was good!                                  DA VINCI                 You want another volunteer, sir?

Master Mind turns to see an INTERVIEW WITH HAL playing on the       muted television. Underneath his face is a blue caption with       white lettering that reads: \"Hal Stewart - Metro City's       Newest Hero?\"                                  NEWS REPORTER                 ...who risked his own life to save                 that of a young mother and her                 child.                                  HAL                 Please, please, you're embarrassing                 me. I saw someone in need and I                 helped them. What more can we ask                 of ourselves. I ask you, what more?              A smile creeps across the evil one's face.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Somebody like him!              EXT.

HAL                 You greedy little bastard. I                 already gave you a twenty.                                  BLIND KID                 Hey, you want me to play along?                 Then pay up, bitch!                                                               38.                                                HAL                 Fine, but you better be convincing.              He gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his       shoulder to see a HOT TEACHER walking toward them.                                  HAL                 Here she comes, go to work.              Like a miniature Brando, the blind kid buries his face in his       hands and begins to cry.                                  BLIND KID                     (weeping)                 Why can't I see! Why God?              Hal puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boy's shoulder.                                  HAL                 Hey, Peter. C'mon champ, let me                 look at you.              The Hot Teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance.              The boy looks up at Hal, tears running down his dark       sunglasses - he should get an Oscar.                                  HAL                 You know, in life we're all given                 no more than we can bear. This                 happened to you maybe because you                 were meant to rise above it - Maybe                 to be an inspiration to the other                 little Peteys out there.                                  BLIND KID                 You really think so, Hal?                                  HAL                 Hey, does it LOOK like I'm lying?                 Now c'mon, go feel your way to                 class before you get your little                 butt suspended.              The boy stands up and is about to take off.                                  HAL                 Petey, wait a minute.              Hal uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the       boy's face before sending him on his way.                                                                39.                            The Hot Teacher grabs her chest. Her heart is about to       absolutely melt.                                  HAL                 Don't run into anything!              EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS              Plato lowers his binoculars. From his perspective, Hal should       be next in line for popehood.                                  PLATO                 I think I've seen enough, sir. This                 is your guy.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                     (over radio)                 Then return to base. We have much                 work to do.              Plato starts up the van and pulls away.              INT. BAR - DAY              It's a busy night. A couple of trucker types are shooting       pool as the bartender slings drinks.              Hal is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a       very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN sitting next to him.              As he goes to straighten his stool-posture, Hal suddenly       catches himself on the bar's TELEVISION - it's a story about       how he saved the woman and her baby at the construction site.              He turns back to the Attractive Woman next to him, then back       to the TV. A plan of attack is forming.                                  HAL                     (obviously playing it up                      for the woman's benefit)                 Oh, there it is again. This is                 really getting embarrassing now.              The woman looks up at the screen and gives Hal a double-take.                                  ATTRACTIVE   WOMAN                 Oh my God! It's you!   You're the man                 who saved that woman   and her baby                 the other day! It is   you, isn't it?              TRUCKER #1, getting a drink at the bar next to them,       OVERHEARS.                                                                40.                            Hal rolls his eyes and puts his hands up in the air.                                  HAL                     (to Attractive Woman)                 Oh, crap. You got me.              TRUCKER#1 taps Hal on the shoulder.                                  TRUCKER#1                 Let me tell you something. That was                 just about the bravest damn thing                 I've ever witnessed. (he turns to                 the rest of the bar) Hey,                 everybody! This guy's the hero from                 TV!              The bar ERUPTS IN CHEERS.              MOMENTS LATER              Hal is riding on the shoulders of TRUCKER#2 and TRUCKER#3 as       `I'm Holding Out For A Hero' plays on the jukebox.              TRUCKER#1 suddenly puts his hands in the air. The room       quickly goes silent.                                  TRUCKER#1                 I want to give you something.              He reaches into his pocket and takes out a medal. He holds it       up in the air for everyone to see.                                  TRUCKER#1 (CONT'D)                 Lost my whole platoon. They were a                 lot a good boys, a lot of good                 boys. That was just the way things                 were in \"The Grenada.\" I'd rather a                 real hero have this.              Trucker#1 gives the medal to a speechless Hal.                                  ATTRACTIVE WOMAN                 Hey, you're on TV again.              The crowd looks up at the Television.              TELEVISION - CONTINUOUS              The anchor man, BRAD HELMS (early 40's, amazing mustache),       suddenly has a memo passed to him.                                                                  41.                                                BRAD HELMS                 This just in. Upon a second look at                 that tape from this morning, which                 we'll now replay for you, it                 appears it was not the heroic act                 it first seemed to be.              The tape shows Hal running in slow motion.                                  BRAD HELMS (O.S.) (CONT'D)                 With the tape slowed down you can                 actually see the man push the woman                 and her child out of the way in an                 effort to save his own life.              The tape shows Hal, in a clear act of self-preservation,       pushing the woman and child out of the way.                                                        CUT BACK TO:              INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS              In unison, everyone turns their heads back to Hal.                                  HAL                 I guess that looks kinda bad.              Trucker#1 snatches his medal back.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              Master Mind, Da Vinci and Plato look down, spotting Hal       cutting through a dark alley.                                  DA VINCI                 There he is, boss.              Da Vinci hands Master Mind a fantastic looking silver rifle.                                  MASTER MIND                 Now, we're sure this won't kill                 him?                                  PLATO                 Yes, sir. He'll just feel a slight                 electrical shock.                                  MASTER MIND                 Good.              Master Mind raises the rifle and aims it at Hal.                                                                 42.                            EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT              Hal wipes the blood from his nose with his shirtsleeve.              A LIGHTENING BOLT suddenly zaps Hal in the back. His teeth       spark and arc electrons as his entire body shakes and       shudders violently. He finally collapses, knocking over a row       of garbage cans.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              An angry Master Mind slaps Plato.                                  MASTER MIND                 Slight electrical shock?              EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT              Hal lies flat on his back, his jacket smoldering.              Dazed, he slowly rises to his feet and looks up at the sky.                                  HAL                 God, I hate the weather in this                 city.              Hal walks off into the night as he attempts to slap the       emitting smoke from his jacket.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              Master Mind turns to Da Vinci.                                  MASTER MIND                 Follow him.              INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              It's a dirty, small studio. Laundry lies everywhere, dishes       are piled in the sink and the litter box looks like a       minefield.              Hal comes staggering in. Through his POV we see the lights       wobble and streak like a hallucination.              He shakes his head trying to clear thing up, but it looks       worse.              Hal makes his way to the kitchen table and plops down on a       chair. The room begins to swim.              His CAT jumps on the table and sits down in front of him.                                                                  43.                            From Hal's POV the cat's face looks like we're seeing it       through a kaleidoscope. Hal seems fascinated by it.                                   CAT                  You don't look so good, man.                                   HAL                  I don't feel good. I was struck by                  freaking lightening.              Suddenly Hal realizes his cat's talking to him.                                   HAL (CONT'D)                  AAAAAAHHHHH! You can talk?                                   CAT                  No, you're just hallucinating. By                  the way, we're out of orange juice.                                   HAL                  AAAAAAHHHHH!              Hal jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself       out on the coffee table.              INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - MORNING              Hal lies in the same position we left him last night.              He sits up and grabs his head. He looks like he has the worst       hangover in the world.              Finally, he remembers last night. He looks around, but not       really sure what he's looking for.                                   HAL                  Man...              Shaking his head, he walks to the kitchen and opens the       refrigerator.              He pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his       mouth. It's empty.              As if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton       to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself.              He shakes the thought from his mind.              BATHROOM              Hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants.                                                               44.                            HAL'S FACE              He stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. The       inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. A content       look washes over his face.              There is a distinct sound of porcelain CRACKING and       SPLINTERING.              The sound intensifies. Hal looks down to see his URINE STREAM       SMASHING THE TOILET.                                      HAL (CONT'D)                    Oh, God!              He whips his stream away only to cut a LONG RIP IN THE WALL.                                      HAL (CONT'D)                    Oh, God!              He freaks out and begins to lose control of his flow as it       destroys everything he accidently aims at; the bathroom       mirror, a bottle of cheap cologne, the bathroom window.                                      HAL (CONT'D)                    Oh, God!              He aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now,       to see the floor give way.              Finally, the pee stops and he glances down the hole.              He sees his downstairs NEIGHBOR sitting at his breakfast       table. He has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the       smashed toilet on his pancakes.              EXT. STREET - DAY              Hal turns the corner to see his bus pulling away from the       stop.                                      HAL                    Wait!              He starts running after it.              ZOOM - HE TAKES OFF LIKE LIGHTENING.                                     HAL (CONT'D)                    Whoa, whoa, whoa!              Unable to stop, he SLAMS INTO THE BACK OF THE BUS and falls       back to the ground.                                                                  45.                            As the bus continues on he sees an INDENTATION of his torso       right below the rear window.              Stunned, to say the least, he rises to his feet.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Something's not right here.              He slaps himself in the face as hard as he can.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Wake up! Wake up, Hal!              HONK!              Hal spins around to see a car barreling toward him.              He goes to jump out of the way - ZOOM - he FLIES TWO STORIES       UP, nails a building and comes crashing back down to the       sidewalk.              Hal sits up, disheveled and scared.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Okay, okay. Let's get it together,                 man.              He closes his eyes in an attempt to will back his sanity.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 This is just some sort                 of...episode. It will pass, it will                 pass.              He opens his eyes and looks down the street. A BEAUTIFUL       NAKED WOMAN is coming toward him.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Well, not too fast I hope.              As she passes him and turns the corner out of his view he       catches ANOTHER NAKED WOMAN - an old disgusting one.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Yes, fast, fast!              He turns away from her in horror only to see AN ENTIRE BLOCK       OF NAKED PEOPLE going about their business.              He rubs his eyes and looks down the street again. Everyone       has returned to a clothed state.                                                               46.                            He relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that he's       floating a foot off the ground.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 I think I need to go home.              INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - DAY              Hal's front door CREAKS as it slowly opens, revealing Master       Mind.              He walks over to the bathroom and smiles to himself as he       notices the giant hole in the floor.                                  MASTER MIND                 Welcome to your second birth, Hal                 Stewart.              Master Mind continues to survey the room. He stops to look       over a \"KARATE KID\" POSTER on Hal's living room wall.              He focuses on the majestic image of Pat Morita teaching a       young Ralph Macchio to kick.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Instruction is very important in                 the formative years. Every hero                 needs a mentor, a father figure to                 look up to.              He presses his special watch, causing his body to MORPH INTO       THE SPITTING-IMAGE OF PAT MORITA.                                   \"PAT MORITA\"                 Perfect.              INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - DAY              Hal enters, grabs a bottle of vodka from atop of the fridge       and takes a long pull from it.                                  VOICE (O.S.)                 A man will usually find that if he                 drinks from a bottle, eventually,                 the bottle drinks from him.              Hal does a SPIT TAKE. In the corner a darkened figure stands.                                  HAL                 Who are you!?                                                                 47.                                                VOICE                 I am the guide on your journey.                 Fate has chosen you to be it's                 champion.              Pat Morita steps out from the shadows.              Hal passes out again.              LATER              We are close on Hal's face as his eyes flutter open. He       appears to be lying on the couch.              He hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is       as it seems.              He lays his head back down.                                  HAL                 Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I                 must be losing it.              A voice sounds right next to his ear.                                  \"PAT MORITA\" (O.S.)                 You know you're out of orange                 juice?              Hal leaps up to find he's been resting his head on Pat's lap.                                  HAL                 Jesus! This isn't happening, this                 isn't happening.              Hal backs away and trips over a box.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Calm. All things must be filtered                 through calmness.                                   HAL                 Bullshit! Sometimes it's best to                 freak out.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 I think we must work on your                 attitude first.                                  HAL                 Look I'm gonna call the cops in                 about two seconds if you don't get                 out of here.                                                               48.                            Pat rises and walks to Hal. He's so calm it makes Hal calm.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Are you calm now?                                  HAL                 Yeah, I'm okay.              Pat slaps him across the face hard.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Good, because we've got a lot of                 work to do.              Hal grabs his jaw.                                  HAL                 What the hell was that for?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Rule number one: expect the                 unexpected.                                   HAL                 Can you just tell me what this is                 all about?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 The heavens are not in the habit of                 bestowing a gift such as this to                 just anyone. You are being rewarded                 for being a man of great moral                 fortitude with an unwavering belief                 in humanity.                                  HAL                 That's me alright.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 I am to train you so you may                 fulfill your destiny to defeat the                 great menace to Metro City: Master                 Mind.              Pat gets up and walks toward the door.                                   \"PAT MORITA\" (CONT'D)                 Come.                                  HAL                 We're are we going?                                                               49.                                                   \"PAT MORITA\"                 To train.              EXT. PAT'S CAR - DAY              Pat is sitting in the driver's seat. The car is bumping up       and down.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Strength is just as much in the                 mind as it is the muscle. Remember,                 both need to be exercised.              We PULL BACK to see Hal lifting the car up over his head.       He's hardly straining.                                  HAL                 I'M LIFTING A FREAKING CAR!!!              Pat leans on the HORN.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Hey, Corky? You listening?              Two highly attractive female joggers run by. They're clearly       impressed with Hal's show of strength. He smiles and mouths a       \"hello.\"                                  HAL                 Yeah, work both muscles.              EXT. DESERT - DAY              Pat cocks back the chamber of a .357 MAGNUM. He holds it up       and carefully takes aim...at Hal's chest.                                     \"PAT MORITA\"                 Trust me.                                  HAL                 What are you doing!?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 An invulnerability test. Something                 wrong?                                  HAL                 Uh...yeah. I would prefer not to                 get shot. Do not fire that thing!              Frustrated, Pat lowers the gun.                                                                50.                                                \"PAT MORITA\"                 You're bulletproof.                                  HAL                 Okay, do you know that for sure?              Pat quickly aims and fires.              Hal lets out a high pitched scream as the bullet ricochets       off his chest.                                    \"PAT MORITA\"                 I do now.              Hal looks down at his chest, not so much as a scratch.                                    HAL                 You suck.              EXT. SKY - DAY              Hal is in the air flying in a sitting position. He's weaving       back and forth.                                  HAL                 Ice Man, I got a bogie on my tail.                 Two Russian Migs coming in hard and                 fast.                                    \"PAT MORITA\"                 Hey!                                    HAL                 What?              Hal looks down to see Pat Morita yelling at him from the roof       of a building down below.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 What did I tell you? Stomach down,                 hands up.              Hal sighs and assumes the proper superhero in-flight       position.                                  HAL                 God, I feel so gay.              Pat's CELL PHONE begins to RING. He answers it.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                     (in Master Mind voice)                 What is it?                                                               51.                                                ROXANNE (V.O.)                 John?              Pat panics. He looks up to make sure no one is in earshot.              He sees Hal now doing somersaults in the air.                                  HAL                 YEEEE HAWWWW!              Pat turns his attention back to the phone, talking in his       John Cusack voice.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                     (in Cusack voice)                 Yes, it's John Cusack.                                   ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Hi, it's Roxanne. Listen, I...I                 really enjoyed talking with you the                 other day.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 ...As did I.                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great. God, I feel really silly,                 and if you have a lot going on I                 totally understand. But, I was                 wondering if you maybe wanted to                 have lunch.              He can't believe what he's hearing.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                     (excited)                 I'd love to!              He quickly recovers his composure.                                  \"PAT MORITA\" (CONT'D)                 I mean, I AM a little hungry.                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great. How does the park sound,                 around noon-ish?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Sure!                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great, see you then.                                                               52.                            Pat hangs up the phone and returns it to his pocket as Hal       lands behind him.                                  HAL                 WHOOOOA! Man, that is so cool. It's                 like fly - Oh my God, I almost said                 it was like flying.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 For the rest of the day I want you                 to continue to practice your flying                 posture.                                  HAL                 Why, where're ya going?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 ...To do something...mysterious                 ...and Asian.                                  HAL                 Say no more, bro. I'll just keep at                 it, then.              EXT. PARK - DAY              John Cusack and Roxanne eat WRAPPED SANDWICHES while walking       through Metro City Park.                                  ROXANNE                 How's your sandwich?                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 It's quite delicious.                                  ROXANNE                 Hope you don't think I'm too                 forward. Some men are intimidated                 when a woman asks them out. I just                 find you really easy to talk to.                                     \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 And I you.                                  ROXANNE                 You know, you're not at all like                 you are in the movies.                                     \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 I'm not?                                                               53.                                                ROXANNE                 Yeah. I don't know - You have this                 strange, refined way of speaking.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 I do? That is most interesting.                                   ROXANNE                 Anyway, when we were talking the                 other day I just felt, even though                 we only talked for a couple of                 hours, that we've known each other                 for years.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 I know just what you mean.              Roxanne bites into her sandwich.                                  ROXANNE                 You know what? This sandwich is                 disgusting.              She tosses it in a nearby garbage can.                                   ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 Of course I already ate half of it.                 I wonder what that says about my                 character?                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 It means you don't give up on a                 sandwich. You see that it has                 potential, and you give it every                 chance to be all it can be.              Roxanne smiles at his analogy.                                  ROXANNE                 Thanks, but knowing me, I was                 probably projecting my expectations                 of what a lunch should be on the                 sandwich. It might have been okay                 at first, but I just made it                 bitter.              John Cusack notices Roxanne's smile starting to fade.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Is that what happened with your                 last sandwich - I mean, boyfriend?                                                               54.                                                ROXANNE                 When I look back, I probably                 shouldn't of expected so much from                 him. He was already a giving                 person. You know, one of those go                 out and save the world types.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 I've run into a few.                                  ROXANNE                 I was selfish, I guess. I didn't                 want to share him with anybody                 else.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 It sounds like he was a special                 man.                                  ROXANNE                 They broke the mold.              John Cusack arches his eyebrow in a very familiar manner.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Perhaps not.              INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY              Hal walks up to Pat Morita sporting a Lone Ranger-type mask       and wearing a purple and red superhero costume. It's not       unlike Uberman's except for a giant \"T\" on his chest. (From       here on, Hal is referred to as TITAN)                                  TITAN                 What's the \"T\" stand for?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Titan.                                  TITAN                 What's that supposed to mean?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 It's from Roman mythology. Zeus's                 father...oh, just go with it. You                 look perfect.                                  TITAN                 I don't think this mask is big                 enough. Are you sure no one is                 gonna recognize me?                                                                55.                                                \"PAT MORITA\"                 It's fine, just don't slouch. It's                 all in the posture.              He grabs Titan's shoulders like a proud papa.                                  \"PAT MORITA\" (CONT'D)                 It is time.              INT. BANK - DAY              There is a long line of people snaked around the velvet       ropes. They're all waiting for their chance at the one open       teller window.              Four men wearing BEATLES MASKS(JOHN,PAUL,GEORGE,AND RINGO)and       CARRYING SHOTGUNS enter the bank.              John fires a shot in the air, sending everyone into an       immediate panic.                                  JOHN                 Alright folks, this is a robbery.                 Nobody moves - yadda, yadda,                 yadda...              Ringo jumps over the teller wall and starts stuffing bills       into a bag.              As John and Paul cover the crowd, George goes to the corner       office and puts a gun to the BANK MANAGER'S head.                                  GEORGE                 The safe. Let's go.                                  BANK MANAGER                 Okay, just don't hurt anyone.                                  GEORGE                 Yeah, yeah, yeah.              George leads him out by the collar.              CRASH - Titan smashes through the window and lands in a bold       superhero stance with hands on hips.                                  TITAN                 Well, boys, there's no need for all                 this just to get the free toaster.              Paul cocks his gun.                                                                  56.                                                PAUL                 What are you suppose to be?              We move in for a nice dramatic close up.                                    TITAN                 Justice.                                  GEORGE                 Well, justice, suck on this...              George, John and Paul open fire on Titan.              He just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him.              With their guns empty the three just stare at him in       amazement.                                  TITAN                 Now it's my turn.              He turns to George.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Hey, George, here comes the sun.              Titan grabs George and throws him into a fluorescent light       fixture in the ceiling.              Paul tries to run for the door. Titan snatches the collar of       his jacket.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Say, Paul, your mother should                 know...that you're a scumbag.              He tosses Paul out the window and into a parked DELIVERY       TRUCK.              Titan turns around just as John hits him with the butt of his       shotgun. It instantly breaks apart in his hands.              Titan lifts him like a rag doll up into the air.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 John, all you need is love...              He throws John who lands on top of a cubical wall - GROIN       FIRST.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 ...and a good urologist.                                                               57.                            Titan effortlessly hops over the teller wall to find Ringo       cowering on the floor.              He grabs him by the shirt and lifts him up.                                  HAL                 Well, Ringo...um...um...you're                 under arrest.              EXT. BANK - DAY              Titan walks out of the bank with Ringo and George under his       arm. He's suddenly swarmed by a group of television       reporters, including Roxanne.              Across the street is Pat Morita. He watches Titan's first       news conference with great anxiety.                                  BANK MANAGER                     (to Hal)                 On behalf of the First National                 Bank of Metro City, I'd like to                 offer you a reward for your act of                 bravery.              He hands Titan a check.                                  TITAN                     (reading)                 Ten thousand dollars!              Titan looks over to Pat, who violently shakes his head no.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                     (unenthusiastically)                 I...can't except this. Law and                 order is it's own...um...reward.              Pat gives him the thumbs up. Pat turns, suddenly seeing       Roxanne with her camera crew. Captivated, his eyes lock on       her.              Meanwhile, Roxanne and her cameraman, SETH, are maneuvering       around the crowd to get closer to Titan.                                  BRAD HELMS (O.S.)                 Not so fast, Roxanne.              They both turn to see Roxanne's reporter rival Brad Helms,       Geraldo without the class, and his cameraman, FRANK.                                  BRAD HELMS                 This story's mine.                                                                  58.                                                ROXANNE                 Listen, Brad. We were just in the                 area. I was just trying to -                                  BRAD HELMS                 I've been in this business long                 enough to know pretty well what you                 were \"just trying to do.\" Besides,                 I heard you couldn't take the big                 game anymore and were put on fluff                 detail?              Dejected, Roxanne turns and motions for Seth to turn the       camera off.                                  SETH                 You're not gonna take that from                 him, are you?                                  ROXANNE                 He's right. Old habit, I guess.                     (to Brad)                 We'll get out of your way.              As they walk off, Brad makes a comment to Frank loud enough       for her to hear.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Besides, I'm sure there's a pancake                 supper somewhere that needs                 covering.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY              ON TELEVISION              We see the news conference on the bank's steps. In the corner       of the screen is written: \"recorded earlier.\"                                  BRAD HELMS                 For months now, since the death of                 Uberman, the citizens of Metro City                 have been holding out for a hero.                 Well, it appears they won't have to                 hold out for much longer as a new                 costumed crusader has suddenly                 stormed onto the scene. Today, at                 the Metro Savings and Trust, a                 masked mystery man single-handedly                 defeated \"The Fab Four Gang.\" Just                 who is this new caped avenger?              Brad holds the microphone to Titan's face.                                                                59.                                                BRAD HELMS                 I'm sure all of our viewers are now                 wondering, what's the \"T\" stand                 for?                                  TITAN                 It's a message to all the scum out                 there. Uberman may be gone, but                 Metro City has a new protector, and                 his name is \"Tighten!\"              Another reporter leans in.                                  REPORTER                 How do you spell that?              We PULL BACK to see Plato and Da Vinci watching this       spectacle. Master Mind is sitting with them, reading a       NEWSPAPER.                                  MASTER MIND                     (reading paper)                 Oh, for heaven's sake. I can't                 believe it. He misspelled his name.              Master Mind holds up the newspaper. The headline reads       \"Metro's New Hero: Tighten.\"                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 No matter, I suppose.              Master Mind throws the paper on the floor and begins to pace       around the room with his arms folded behind his back.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 We've now fully established Titan                 as Metro City's hero. They will                 love him just as they loved                 Uberman. Everything is going                 according to plan.              Einstein leans over and whispers in Plato's ear.                                  EINSTEIN                     (whispering)                 Yeah, if the plan is getting us in                 jail.              Master Mind turns around, facing Einstein. He walks over,       standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen.                                                               60.                                                MASTER MIND                 You know, Einstein, maybe I should                 have called you Socrates. He also                 didn't know when to keep his                 thoughts to himself.                                   EINSTEIN                 I just fail to see the point in all                 of this. I mean, why are we                 creating another superhero when it                 was such a pain in the ass for you                 to get rid of the other one? I                 mean, Uberman is destroyed, we                 should be using this opportunity                 to...to...                                    MASTER MIND                 To what?                                  EINSTEIN                 I don't know. To take over the                 weather, space, the world -                 whatever super villains are                 SUPPOSED to do.                                  MASTER MIND                 The reason someone like you will                 always be a minion is because you                 have no foresight. We take over the                 earth, like you said. Then what?                 Women? Cars? Money? Even the                 grandest treasures will lose their                 lustre if you don't have someone to                 hold them over.              Einstein throws up his hands. He's had enough. He pulls off       his wig and throws it to the floor.                                  EINSTEIN                 That's it! This balance of the                 force bullshit is getting way too                 Oprah for me. I'm blowing. Who's                 with me?                                    MASTER MIND                 You dare?                                  EINSTEIN                 Yeah, I dare. I'm sick of wearing                 stupid costumes, and I'm sick of                 working for a super villain who's                 turning into a softie.                                                               61.                            Plato and Da Vinci's mouths drop to the floor. They turn to       Master Mind for his rebuttal.                                  MASTER MIND                 What - did - you - call me?                                  EINSTEIN                 You heard me. You used to be an                 inhuman monster, now look at you.                 You're creating super heroes, you                 don't go with us on robberies                 anymore, it's been days since you                 threatened anyone, oh, and not to                 mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing.                                  MASTER MIND                 THAT is none of your business,                 knave!                                  EINSTEIN                 Hey, you guys haven't sealed the                 deal yet, have you?                                   MASTER MIND                 Silence!                                  EINSTEIN                     (In a woman's voice)                 Oh, Master, your head is so big.                                  MASTER MIND                 I'm warning you, Einstein.                                  EINSTEIN                     (In a woman's voice)                 Take me!                                  MASTER MIND                 I said silence!              With his metal gauntlet Master Mind grabs Einstein by the       throat and lifts him into the air.              Einstein looks frightened as he tries to pry himself free of       Master Mind's grip.              Master Mind's eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not       into what he's about to do. He let's Einstein drop to the       floor.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Get out of my sight.                                                                62.                            EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT              Roxanne and John Cusack are eating on the outside patio of a       fancy restaurant.                                  ROXANNE                 Don't get me wrong, I love being a                 reporter. I don't think I could do                 anything else. It's the                 consequences of what we do that I'm                 having a problem with.              He listens intently as he refills her glass with wine.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 That's where journalistic                 responsibility comes in, no?                                  ROXANNE                 It's supposed to.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Sounds to me like you're running                 from something.                                  ROXANNE                 I got someone I cared about killed.                 If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't                 have been involved.              John suddenly gets a disturbed look in his eye, realizing       what she's talking about.              He reaches across the table and takes her hand.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 You can't blame yourself. My father                 used to say each of us must answer                 the great call to truly feel alive.                                  ROXANNE                 Was he an actor?                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 ...No. He was...a landscaper. And a                 horrible one. I mean he would fail                 time and time again at                 his...landscaping. And sometimes                 he'd get pretty beaten up or thrown                 in jail -                                  ROXANNE                 Jail?                                                               63.                                                \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 My point is he took the good with                 the bad. He grew a little each                 time. Improved, learned.                                  ROXANNE                 Was he ever successful?                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 God, no...but don't let deter you.              Roxanne LAUGHS.                                  ROXANNE                 Thanks for this. You know, this is                 embarrassing, but it's been a long                 time since I -              It's starting to lightly sprinkle. Roxanne looks up.                                  ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 I think it's starting to rain. We                 might want to find a table inside.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 What were you gonna say?                                  ROXANNE                 Oh, I was gonna say...It's been a                 long time since...well, I've been                 with someone I...enjoy being with.              John Cusack smiles warmly and raises his glass for a toast.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 To people who enjoy being with each                 other.              They go to clang glasses, when the rain suddenly causes John       Cusack's disguise generator to short.              His true form of Master Mind is briefly revealed to Roxanne       as a BOLT OF ELECTRICITY encircles his body.              Roxanne drops her glass and jumps out of her seat.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Oh, no. Don't look at me.              LIKE A BROKEN TV the image keeps switching between MASTER       MIND AND JOHN CUSACK.                                                               64.                            As Master Mind starts to franticly slap at his watch, the       Cusack disguise begins to hold steady.              He nonchalantly returns to cutting his steak.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Okay, never mind that. Now, where                 were we?              Roxanne grabs his glass and throws the drink in his face,       causing the generator to short out permanently.              Master Mind now sits in his true blue form.                                     ROXANNE                 Oh my God.                                  MASTER MIND                 You're not gonna get all freaky                 about this, are you?                                  ROXANNE                 This...this is too much, even for                 you. God, I go out with you, tell                 you my innermost thoughts.                                  MASTER MIND                 I only did this because I wanted to                 talk to you on the same level. You                 know, without all the baggage?                                  ROXANNE                 Baggage? You burned my boyfriend                 alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch!                                  MASTER MIND                 You see, that's exactly what I'm                 talking about.              Roxanne starts to walk away.                                     MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Roxanne!                                  ROXANNE                 Stay away from me.              Master Mind sinks back down to his chair. Despite the now       heavy rain bombarding him, he returns to his food.              Several resturaunt patron's are looking at him through the       window.                                                                  65.                            Our villain turns to them, giving them a villainous glare.                                  MASTER MIND                 What?              INT. MASTER MIND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT              Master Mind is lying on his back, wide awake.                                  MASTER MIND                     (mumbling to himself)                 Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato,                 it's his fault. He's the one who                 sent me on this weak-willed path.                 I'll filet his scrotum for this.                 Me, a creature of evil, in love                 with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous.                 I hardly give such matters thought              He rolls onto his side. He yawns and closes his eyes.              Suddenly, they shoot back open.                                                       CUT TO:              EXT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              Master Mind pulls up in a blue Rolls Royce, across the street       from Roxanne's apartment              He stares up at the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of       her.              Finally, she appears, primping her hair in her apartment       window's reflection.                                  MASTER MIND                 I should just go up there and just                 lay it all out to her. \"Roxanne, I                 like you - I always have. Oh, and                 I'm sorry I blew up your ex.                 (realizing the absurdity of his                 words) Yeah, that would go over                 like a pants-less clown at a                 child's birthday party. What the                 hell am I even doing here? Who                 cares what she thinks? I'm a                 supervillain and here I am acting                 like a love struck schoolboy.                 Forget this. I control my own                 destiny!                                                                 66.                            He turns the ignition key - NOTHING HAPPENS. He repeats but       gets the same results.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                     (disgusted)                 Perfect.              INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              She pulls a pack of smokes off her night stand. Empty.                                     ROXANNE                 Damn.              She grabs her long coat and throws it over her robe.              EXT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING              Roxanne steps outside.                                  ROXANNE                 Please be open.              Across the street is a liquor store. The light is still on.                                     ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 Thank God.              She walks across the street, passing in front of Master       Mind's car.              Spotting her, he sinks down in his seat.              Roxanne walks by, totally unaware of his presence.              Relieved, Master Mind sits back up and watches her go into       the store.              INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              Roxanne walks up to an elderly Korean SHOPKEEPER at the       counter.                                  ROXANNE                 A pack of Lady Strikes, please.              EXT. MASTER MIND'S CAR - NIGHT              Master Mind is talking on his cell phone.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hello, Triple A?                                                                  67.                            He suddenly spots something across the street.              EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              A HOODLUM walks up to the entrance of the store and pulls out       a gun from under his coat.              EXT. MASTER MIND'S CAR - NIGHT              Master Mind stares in shock.                                  MASTER MIND                 I'll call you back.              He hangs up the phone and watches the Hoodlum go inside the       store.              INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              The Hoodlum reaches across the counter and grabs a fist full       of cash from the register.                                  SHOPKEEPER                 Hey!                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 Shut up, Gramps.              He turns to Roxanne, spotting a GOLD NECKLACE around her       neck.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM (CONT'D)                 Gimme that necklace!                                  ROXANNE                 I don't think so.              The Hoodlum cocks his shotgun.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 I said give it to me!                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 The lady said no.              The hoodlum turns around to see Master Mind in the doorway       holding a STRANGE-LOOKING HAND CANNON (GOO GUN) with knobs       and blinking lights.              The hoodlum starts to laugh.                                                               68.                                                SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 What the hell's that? A super                 soaker?                                  MASTER MIND                 No, it's a goo gun.              The hoodlum turns his gun to Master Mind.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 Yeah, what's it do?                                   MASTER MIND                 It goos.              Master Mind fires the cannon. It instantly covers the store       in a cloud of SMOKE.              The smoke clears to reveal the hoodlum STUCK TO THE WALL,       covered in a thick, GREEN GUNK.              Roxanne stares at him, dumbfounded.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 It's...a prototype.              Master Mind starts to walk out when he's suddenly confronted       by the shopkeeper.                                  SHOPKEEPER                 I know you! You Master Brain guy.                 You a hero.              Master Mind points the goo gun at him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Don't - EVER - say that again.              EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              Master Mind walks out with the cannon resting on his shoulder       like he's a short timer in Da Nang. Roxanne follows shortly       behind him.                                   ROXANNE                 Hey!              Master Mind turns around.                                  ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 Are you following me or something?                                                                69.                                                MASTER MIND                 Don't flatter yourself.              He turns away and continues walking. Roxanne runs in front of       him blocking his way.                                  ROXANNE                 Don't walk away from me when I'm                 talking to you.              Finally it occurs to her what's going on.                                  ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 What a minute...all that stuff you                 use to say to me when Uberman was                 alive - about me being the loyal                 queen by your side as you rule over                 Metro City. That wasn't just super                 villain rhetoric, was it? You                 actually meant it!                                  MASTER MIND                 My, someone has a rather high                 opinion of themselves.              They stare at each other in silence, their glares locked in       conflict.                                  ROXANNE                     (coldly)                 Do you really think I would be with                 someone like you?              This stings Master Mind to the bone. And after a brief       contemplation, he reaches the only logical, painful       conclusion.                                  MASTER MIND                 No.              With that, Master Mind exits into the night, leaving Roxanne       with a baffled expression on her face.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT              Master Mind enters in a huff. Da Vinci closes the door behind       him as Plato notices his master's agitated state.                                  PLATO                 Everything alright, sir?              Master Mind GRABS PLATO BY THE GROIN with his metal gauntlet       causing Plato's eyes to bulge in pain.                                                               70.                                                MASTER MIND                     (overly calm)                 Fine, why do you ask?                                  PLATO                 You...just...seem...              Master Mind tightens his grip.                                    MASTER MIND                 Go on.                                  PLATO                 ...distracted.              Master Mind releases him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Just with business, my minion. Just                 with business. I've decided it is                 time.                                    PLATO                 You mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, we've created our hero, now                 it's time to give him a little                 motivation.                                  DA VINCI                 How do we do that?                                  MASTER MIND                 To be simply good is not enough. A                 hero must be driven by an almost                 relentless desire to right a wrong                 that can never be corrected.                                    PLATO                 You mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, he must lose someone near and                 dear to him - his father figure.                 Gentlemen, it's time for Operation                 Mentor Kill!              EXT. SKY OVER METRO CITY - DAY              Titan flies high over and through the city, under bridges,       between buildings, etc. He's not really working, just       enjoying himself.                                                                  71.                            INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              A PRETTY WOMAN sits at her makeup table wearing nothing but       her bra and panties. Through the reflection in her mirror we       see a large window directly behind her.              As she applies lipstick we see Titan fly quickly by in the       background. After a moment he slowly slides back in view and       begins ogling the girl.              She sees him in the mirror and quickly covers herself with a       robe.              Titan tries to hide his face as he zooms off.              MOMENTS LATER              Titan looks down to see an APARTMENT BUILDING IN RUIN.       Emergency lights flash around it as swarms of people run       around in chaos.                                  TITAN                 Man, what the hell happened down                 there? Wait a sec -              He stops in mid-air as he comes to the striking realization.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 THAT'S MY APARTMENT!!!              EXT. HAL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              Titan lands in front of the rubble that was once his home.       Reporters stand just beyond the police line.                                    TITAN                 Crap.              From the wreckage crawls a dying Pat Morita.                                    TITAN (CONT'D)                 PAT!              Titan goes and kneels beside Pat, holding him in his arms.                                    TITAN (CONT'D)                 You okay?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 I'm dying, kid. There is just one                 last lesson I have for you. It is                 the most important of all.                                                                 72.                                                TITAN                 What's that?                                   \"PAT MORITA\"                 Master Mind did this, you must                 avenge me.                                  TITAN                 Master Mind? Why?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Because he's evil. You must stop                 the evil Hal - stop the...              Pat's body goes limp.              The cameras begin to pop and flash around them.              Titan gently lays Pat's body down and stands respectfully       over him. The reporters rush over.                                  REPORTER 1                 Tighten, Is this the work of Master                 Mind?                                  REPORTER 2                 How will the death of your mentor                 affect your resolve?                                  REPORTER 3                 Was that Pat Morita?              Titan walks up to one of the cameras.                                  TITAN                 This injustice will not go                 unpunished. Master Mind, if you can                 hear me, Tighten is coming for you.              In the background we see Plato and Da Vinci, DRESSED AS       PARAMEDICS, load pat's body onto a stretcher.              PLATO ACCIDENTALLY DROPS HIS SIDE. As he bends down to pick       it back up, Pat quickly slaps him, then goes back to playing       dead.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Master Mind and the boys prepare the fortress for Hal's       revenge attack. Master Mind is as giddy as a schoolboy.                                                               73.                                                MASTER MIND                 Alright, people, we don't have much                 time. Titan should be here any                 minute, so let's get the lead out.              There is a GIANT MOUNTED DEATH RAY in the middle of the hall       being tinkered with by Da Vinci.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 How's the death ray coming?                                  DA VINCI                 Nearly up to full power, sir.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hum. Let's turn it down a few                 notches. It's his first time and                 we don't want to get in a lucky                 shot, now do we?              Plato enters the room.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Anything on the radar yet?                                  PLATO                 Not yet, sir.                                  MASTER MIND                 I see. Well, he must be planning                 something big. Are the flame                 androids deployed?                                  PLATO                 All twelve.              Master Mind rubs his hands in anticipation as he sits down on       his throne.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da                 Vinci, take your places next to me.              They move to either side of the chair.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 No slouching.              Da Vinci straightens up and sucks in his gut.              They remain this way for several long moments. Master Mind       occasionally glances at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the wall. Still no       Titan.                                                                74.                            LATER              Apparently quite some time has passed. The bold stances have       degraded to fatigue.                                  PLATO                 He's certainly taking his time.                                  MASTER MIND                 He'll be here. That's the way it                 works.              STILL LATER              Master Mind reclines in his chair and taps his metal gauntlet       impatiently on the armrest.              Plato has squatted down, resting his chin on his hand.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Unprofessional, that's what this                 is. No, it's disrespect for the                 craft.              Master Mind rises and begins to pace back and forth.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Would Uberman have kept us waiting                 like this? Of course not. He was a                 pro who knew the score. It's time                 we spelled out a few things for                 this Titan. I will not be made a                 fool of.              He storms out of the room.              INT. HAL'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY              Titan's sitting on the floor in a barren apartment wearing       his costume top and some tighty whities. He sips his beer as       he watches a basketball game on a tiny TV.              Much to his annoyance, there's a KNOCK at the door.                                  TITAN                 Oh, for crying out loud.              He gets up and opens the door. It's Master Mind.                                  MASTER MIND                 Do you know who I am?                                                                  75.                            It takes a few moments to register, but Titan's suddenly       excited.                                  TITAN                 Yeah, you're Master Mind. Yeah!                 You're actually the guy I want to                 see!                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh, so NOW you want to get down to                 it. Well, I want to get a few                 things off my chest first.              Master Mind walks past Titan into the apartment. He spins       around, pointing at him accusingly with one of his metal       fingers.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Of all the inconsiderate - Do you                 have any idea how long we waited                 for you? We're you even planning on                 coming to me and getting revenge?              Titan shuts the apartment door, and turns back toward his       guest.                                  TITAN                 Well, at first I was going to. You                 know, because that's what I figured                 I was supposed to do. But then I                 got to thinking-                                  MASTER MIND                     (interrupting)                 -You got to thinking? There's                 nothing to think about. I'm the                 villain. I do something bad, you                 come and get me.                                  TITAN                 - I got to thinking...what's the                 point?              Master Mind throws up his hands.                                  MASTER MIND                 Maybe you're right. What's the                 point?              He suddenly notices something in the corner of his eye. He       walks over to a futon in the living room. On top of it is a       LARGE SACK OVERFLOWING WITH GOLD WATCHES,RINGS AND OTHER       VALUABLES.                                                               76.                                                MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 What are these?                                  TITAN                 That's what I wanted to talk to you                 about.                                  MASTER MIND                     (baffled)                 Where did you get all this?                                  TITAN                     (proudly)                 Get this: I stole them.                                  MASTER MIND                 From where?                                  TITAN                 From all over. You see, once you                 killed Pat and ruined my other                 apartment building I was pretty                 pissed off, so I figured I'd go,                 find you and kick some ass. Then I                 thought to myself: \"Okay,then                 what?\" I mean, if we were to fight,                 what would I get out of it? Would I                 get my apartment back? Would I be                 able to pay the bills?                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, what about your mentor?                                  TITAN                 Tell you the truth? He was kind of                 a dick. I mean, being a hero is                 dandy and all, but it's volunteer                 work. Now you've always had the                 right take on all this. I mean,                 when you rob a bank or take over                 the diamond exchange you get                 something out of it. I mean, when                 you don't get caught, which, no                 offense, isn't very often. And that                 brings me to what I wanted to                 propose to you: Who could catch you                 if I'm by your side?              Perplexed by his proposal, Master Mind just stares at Titan       awe-struck.                                  MASTER MIND                 You want to team-up?                                                                  77.                                                TITAN                 You got the brains, I got the                 brawn. We could even call ourselves                 that: `Brain' and `Brawn'. Look at                 this.              Titan picks up a piece of POSTER BOARD off the floor and       shows it to Master Mind.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 I even designed us some new                 costumes.              The picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons.       A big headed man (Master Mind) is standing on a plate of       grass in a blue costume with a picture of a brain on his       chest.              Next to him, is a picture of Titan in a red costume with a       black cape, but his chest is mysteriously blank.              Titan proudly points to the two figures.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 See, you'd be brain, so you got a                 little one on your costume, and                 then I'll have brawn on mine...once                 I figure out the best, you know,                 visual interpretation of it. What                 do you think?                                  MASTER MIND                 What do I think?              Master Mind shakes his head tiredly.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 I think you're probably the biggest                 idiot I've ever met. I mean, I                 can't believe you. All your gifts,                 all your powers, and all you want                 to use them for is your own                 financial fulfillment. You know                 what? Your kind of people make me                 sick.              Titan puts down his drawing.                                  TITAN                 I worked hard on this.                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh - gee - I am so sorry!                                                               78.                            Master Mind looks to Heaven in disgust.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                     (under his breath)                 Of all the people to pick, it had                 to be this loser.              This strikes a cord with Titan.                                  TITAN                 Now, hold on. You're going a little                 too far.                                  MASTER MIND                 I wish your mother said that to                 your father the night of your                 conception, they would have saved                 me a whole lot of heartache.                                  TITAN                 Hey, I mean it.              Master Mind gets right in his face.                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?              EXT. HAL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              We see Master Mind's body CRASH through the building and land       in a DUMPSTER across the street.              A car pulls up. The driver's door opens. Da Vinci gets out       and runs to help his master.                                    DA VINCI                 Master!                                    MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 It hurts.              Da Vinci peeks into the dumpster to see Master Mind's body       cushioned by a stack of trash bags.                                  DA VINCI                 What hurts?                                    MASTER MIND                 It!              The overly large henchmen starts to pull his master from the       dumpster when they suddenly hear a voice from above. It's       Titan peeking through the hole in his apartment wall.                                                                  79.                                                TITAN                 I don't need you, I don't need                 anybody. I have the power to do and                 take anything I want. And now, I'm                 gonna take back everything this                 city owes me. Beware Metro City,                 it's time for Titan to collect.              Titan shoots up into the air.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Oh, and from now on - I'M GONNA FLY                 THE WAY I WANT TO FLY!              He takes a sitting position and flies away as if he were       piloting an invisible jet.              Master Mind climbs out of the dumpster and watches Titan       disappear into the distance.                                  DA VINCI                 How'd the plan go, boss?                                  MASTER MIND                 I just made myself redundant, old                 friend.              Da Vinci gives Master Mind a whiff.                                  DA VINCI                 It's not that bad.              INT. BANK - DAY              Titan, with a happy bounce in his step, enters the bank. The       last time he was here he thwarted a robbery. He looks       nostalgic.              A SECURITY GUARD shyly walks up to him like a kid meeting his       TV idol.                                  SECURITY GUARD                 Morning, Tighten.                                   TITAN                 Morning.                                  SECURITY GUARD                 Is there something we can do for                 you?                                                                  80.                                                   TITAN                    Oh, don't bother about me. I'm just                    here to make a withdrawal.              Titan walks across the lobby, drawing stares of admiration       from all.              A little girl waves to him sweetly. He gives her a good-       natured WINK as he heads straight for the vault.              The security guard watches him enter and come out with a SACK       OF CASH.              Sure he must be misunderstanding what's going on, the       security guard just stares at Titan as he passes by and out       the door.              The bank manager comes over to the guard.                                     BANK MANAGER                    Say, did he just rob us?                                     SECURITY GUARD                    Not sure. Sort of looks it, don't                    it?                                     BANK MANAGER                    Yeah.                                     SECURITY GUARD                    Should I, you know, stop him?                                     BANK MANAGER                    Umm...Yeah.              As the security guard exits the bank, the manager stares out       the window. His eyes suddenly grow wide with terror.              The guard's body suddenly smashes through the window, landing       at the startled bank manager's feet.                                     BANK MANAGER (CONT'D)                        (looking down at the                         guard)                    He did rob us, didn't he?                                                           CUT TO:              TELEVISION              \"A Channel 7 News Special Report.\" Brad Helms wipes into       view.                                                               81.                                                BRAD HELMS                 \"Absolute power corrupts                 absolutely.\" When Lord Acton stated                 that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell                 Creighton in 1887, no one thought                 much about it, but today Metro City                 is reeling from that very prophecy.                 Tighten, who many thought of as our                 savior, has turned his back on the                 cause of justice.                                                        CUT TO:              TITAN BEING EVIL - MONTAGE              EXT. DIAMOND EXCHANGE - DAY              Titan flies through the window of the building. He emerges       seconds later laughing with his shirt full of booty.              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              A woman screams from the window of a BURNING BUILDING. Titan       flies up to her, grabs her fur coat and zooms off again,       leaving the woman behind, slightly confused.              EXT. OUTSIDE MARKET - DAY              Titan steals a little boy's lollipop and gooses his mother.              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              Dozens of people run through the streets apparently to get       out of a downpour. We cut to the top of a building and see       Titan ZIPPING UP HIS PANTS and laughing.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Master Mind paces back and forth in front of Plato and Da       Vinci.                                  PLATO                 I don't understand it. He seemed to                 have every characteristic we were                 looking for in a superhero.                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, there's no use crying about                 it now, we must take action. I'm                 not going to play second fiddle to                 that crass buffoon. We must destroy                 Tighten.                                                                  82.                                                PLATO                 It won't be easy. Uberman had a                 sense of decency and genuine love                 for the people. That was his                 weakness and was easily used                 against him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, but he possesses the same                 flaws present in Uberman's DNA -                 copper. It's like Benjamin Franklin                 always said: \"If something works                 don't dick with it.\"              EXT. BAR - DAY              It looks like a war zone passed through here. Smashed police       cars and debris lay everywhere. This seems to be the only       building left untouched.              INT. BAR - DAY              A very tipsy Titan is sitting at the bar, looking deep into       the bottom of his beer glass for answers.                                  TITAN                 I can have anything I want. I'm                 like a god.              The BARTENDER just listens as he wipes down a glass with a       dirty rag.                                  TITAN                 Point to any woman in this bar. I                 could have her in a second.              He follows the bartender's gaze to THE ONLY OTHER PERSON       THERE - A passed out, MIDDLE AGED HAG OF A BARFLY.                                  TITAN                     (to Old Barfly)                 Hey, you wanna get with this?                                  BARTENDER                 Buddy, what do you want?              Titan carefully considers this for a moment.                                  TITAN                 What do you want? That's the                 question, isn't it. I mean, what do                 you want when you can have                 everything?                           (MORE)                                                                 83.                           TITAN(cont'd)                 I suppose what I really want is to                 never be forgotten again. I want to                 do something that can never be cast                 aside or one-upped. I want a -                 what's it called? - A legacy. I                 want a legacy. Yeah, that's it. I                 like the sound that.                                  BARTENDER                 I meant, what do you want to drink?                                  TITAN                 Oh.              EXT. BAR - LATER              Titan stumbles out of the bar, carrying a large sack of       money.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Your time has come to an end,                 Titan!              He looks up to see Master Mind suddenly standing before him.                                  TITAN                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 There can be only one master                 criminal in this city - and it's                 me.                                  TITAN                 Really?              Titan melodramatically throws up his arms.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 I guess I should leave town then,                 huh?                                  MASTER MIND                 I have a better idea - NOW!              Two floors up Da Vinci releases a rope. A COPPER CAGE, like       the one that caged Uberman, drops down on top of Titan.              Titan nonchalantly surveys the cage. He walks to the bars,       tries to pull them apart but can't.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 That's copper my good man. Your one                 weakness.                           (MORE)                                                                 84.                           MASTER MIND(cont'd)                 For all your amazing gifts of brawn                 you are no match for my intellect.              Titan thinks for a moment. Suddenly, he starts to SPIN like a       human top, DRILLING HIMSELF INTO THE STREET BELOW.              As he disappears beneath the surface, we see a shocked look       on Master Mind's face until Titan suddenly explodes out from       under the street in front of him.              Master Mind stares up at him, dumbfounded.              Titan makes like he's going to strike him down, but stops.                                  TITAN                 You know what? You're nothing but a                 bug. Not even worth my effort.              He turns his back to Master Mind and continues down the       street.              Plato makes his way from the shadows to join his master. They       watch Titan shrink into the distance.                                  MASTER MIND                 He's not as dumb as I thought.                                  PLATO                 I guess not...Funny, though.                                  MASTER MIND                 What's funny?                                  PLATO                 Funny Uberman didn't think of the                 same thing.              EXT. HIGH ABOVE METRO CITY - DAY              As Titan flies, he looks down at the rooftops of the city       below.              Suddenly, something catches his attention.                                     HAL                 That's it!              He stops, hovering in place as he looks down below.              The buildings, which make up the heart of downtown Metro, are       in a PERFECT TRIANGLE with a long strip of street leading up       to it. It sorta looks like a bowling lane.                                                                 85.                                                HAL                 Hello, Legacy.              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              Vinnie and his goons come running out as the hear a       COMMOTION.              They look up to see Titan ripping off THE GIANT BOWLING BALL       from the top of the establishment.                                  VINNIE                 Hey, that's my ball!              INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              Roxanne enters the building's elevator. Just before the door       closes an ELDERLY WOMAN slides in.                                  ELDERLY WOMAN                 That was a close one. Sixth floor,                 please.              Roxanne smiles and goes to press the button.              The elderly woman suddenly pulls out a SPRAY CAN, shooting a       MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING MIST into Roxanne's face. She falls to the       floor unconscious.              INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - DAY              Roxanne awakens, finding herself tied to a chair in her       living room.              We hear NOISE from a TV in the background as she tries to       adjust her vision.              Slowly, the blurry figure before her becomes clear.              It's Master Mind. He sits on her Lazy-Boy, reading what looks       to be some kind of JOURNAL.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wow, I always thought Uberman was                 your first superhero - but it looks                 like our little Roxanne dated a                 linebacker in college.                                  ROXANNE                 That's my diary.                                    MASTER MIND                 So it is.                                                                  86.                                                ROXANNE                 It's personal.                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, then I wouldn't leave it in                 your underwear drawer for just                 anyone to find.              He throws the diary over his shoulder.                                  ROXANNE                 What do you want?                                  MASTER MIND                 I need your help.                                  ROXANNE                 So you knock me out and tie me to a                 chair?                                  MASTER MIND                 You're not going to like what I'm                 about to tell you.              As she tries to shake off her headache from being knocked       unconscious, Roxanne spots something on the TV.              ON TELEVISION              Brad Helms is huddled behind a van.                                  BRAD HELMS                 It's chaos here in city square as                 city police -              Behind him, Titan picks up a POLICE CAR and throws it at a       PADDY WAGON. Both vehicles EXPLODE on impact.              BACK TO SCENE                                  ROXANNE                 He's really out of control.                                  MASTER MIND                 Tell me about it.              As if finally realizing something, Roxanne looks back at       Master Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 I should have known. You have                 something to do with this, don't                 you? - With Titan turning evil.                                                               87.                                                MASTER MIND                 Well, the evil thing he did by                 himself. My goal was to give MYSELF                 purpose by creating an intellectual                 sparring partner.                                  ROXANNE                     (confused)                 You're talking like you made him.                                  MASTER MIND                 And they call me Master Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 Let me get this straight. You                 missed getting your ass kicked, so                 you made a new guy to kick your                 ass. That's pathetic.                                  MASTER MIND                 In hindsight...              Roxanne turns back to the TV to see a group of POLICE       OFFICERS open fire on Titan. The bullets just deflect off his       chest.                                  ROXANNE                 And his powers, they're just like                 Uberman's. Why would he have his                 powers?                                  MASTER MIND                     (almost ashamed)                 I had some left over from                 something. I infused him with it.                                  ROXANNE                 YOU DID WHAT!?              Driven by rage, she struggles to tear out of her bonds. She       finally relents, giving Master Mind a look fueled by pure       hatred.                                  MASTER MIND                 Yeah, that's why I decided to tie                 you up.                                  ROXANNE                 You did all this because you wanted                 purpose?                                  MASTER MIND                 He seemed nice.                                                                  88.                            TELEVISION              Titan is standing on top of a destroyed police car. He waves       for the camera to zoom in on him.                                     TITAN                    Closer. I want to show the people                    my real face.              He pulls off his mask, revealing himself as Hal Stewart to       the public for the first time.                                     TITAN (CONT'D)                    Recognize me?              BACK TO SCENE                                     ROXANNE                    Hal Stewart. He's the guy we                    thought saved that woman and kid.                    Turned out he was just trying to                    save his own ass.                                     MASTER MIND                    Yeah, good to know - NOW!              TELEVISION              Titan throws the mask over this shoulder and hops off the       car.                                     TITAN                    That's right, I'm really Hal                    Stewart. Former hero and bowling                    teacher at Kingpin's Bowling.              BACK TO SCENE              Roxanne turns to Master Mind, condescending him with her       eyes.                                      ROXANNE                    You picked a bowler to give super                    powers to?                                     MASTER MIND                    It's a modest profession!              TELEVISION                                                               89.                                                TITAN                 With my new found power, I've                 recently started to wonder what                 sort of legacy I should leave.                 Should I be a hero? I tried that                 once before - even saved a lady and                 her baby from being squashed. I was                 treated like a god until everyone                 started to shit on me - Okay, so                 what if I didn't \"purposely\" save                 them!              He walks over and puts his hand on a large circular concrete       shape just off camera.                                  TITAN                 Well, I'm going to make something                 that can't be taken away from me.                 I'm going to create a permanent                 monument to my greatness. One that                 won't be so easily forgotten or                 erased.              The camera pulls back revealing THE GIANT CONCRETE BOWLING       BALL from Kingpin's.                                  TITAN                 I intend to create a new category                 in the Guinness Book of World's                 Records by rolling the biggest                 strike in the history of bowling.              He grabs the camera and points it to the DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS.       We realize they are PERFECTLY ALIGNED IN BOWLING PIN       FORMATION.                                  TITAN                 My thanks to the city planning                 commission. This wouldn't have been                 possible without them.              Titan grabs the camera so it's pointing back at him again.                                  TITAN                 Tell your friends and family to                 tune in right here to this station                 at noon tomorrow.              BACK TO SCENE                                  ROXANNE                 My god, he's nuts. That'll destroy                 the whole business triangle.                                                               90.                            Master Mind seems to be contemplating something - something       bad.                                     ROXANNE                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 My lair is in the direct path of                 the ball.                                  ROXANNE                 Oh, real nice. Wouldn't want                 anything to happen to your hideout,                 would we?                                  MASTER MIND                 You don't understand. I have                 certain equipment that's - that's                 highly unstable.                                  ROXANNE                 What do you mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 I sort of have a hydrogen reactor,                 okay?                                  ROXANNE                 A HYDROGEN reactor?                                  MASTER MIND                 It's experimental - only one in the                 world...Well, how do you think I                 power all my inventions? Someone                 like me can't pay for electricity.                 The bills would be outrageous.                                     ROXANNE                 A REACTOR?                                  MASTER MIND                 It creates 100 times the output of                 a nuclear one...If destroyed it                 could...                                  ROXANNE                 - Vaporize the entire city!                                  MASTER MIND                     (proudly)                 Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard,                 actually. That little baby is                 amazing. I'm quite proud of it.                           (MORE)                                                                91.                           MASTER MIND(cont'd)                     (off her deadpan reaction)                 I mean...we'd better find a way to                 stop him.              Master Mind thinks a moment.                                  MASTER MIND                 Did Uberman have a hideout?                                  ROXANNE                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 A cave, a solitary fortress of some                 kind. C'mon, all heros have a place                 to hang their capes up in. Roxanne,                 it may be our only chance to find                 something, a clue, anything that                 could give us a fighting chance.                                  ROXANNE                 It's under his house.                                  MASTER MIND                 Whose house?              Roxanne can hardly believe what she's telling him.                                  ROXANNE                 Wayne Scott's.              Master Mind shoots up out of his chair.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne                 Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy                 philanthropist? But he disappeared -                                   ROXANNE                      (interrupting)                 He disappeared just over two months                 ago when you killed him. Not only                 did you rid the world of a hero,                 you killed a kind, noble, generous                 man.              Perhaps ashamed, the super villain hangs his head.              Master Mind walks behind Roxanne and undoes her bonds.              Rubbing her wrists, she watches him as he walks over to the       door.                                                                  92.                                                ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 Looks like you got what you always                 wanted. Uberman is out of the                 picture and Metro City is doomed.              He grabs the door knob and stops, considering her words.                                  MASTER MIND                 \"Metro City doomed.\" You know, I                 never thought I'd say something                 like this, but here it goes -              He slowly turns to her, CUE HEROIC MUSIC.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Not if I have anything to say about                 it.              EXT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHT              Master Mind stands before the huge, Gothic structure in awe.                                  MASTER MIND                 Such a dark place for one such as                 you. I wonder, underneath your                 noble deeds, what inner demons                 drove you to your endless crusade                 for justice?              He walks to the front entrance. The double doors have been       sealed shut with boards and nails. Master Mind begins to tear       them off with his metal hand.              INT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHT              The doors opens. A beam of moonlight immediately pierces the       darkness, forming an illuminated path into the heart of the       manor.              Master Mind enters.              Covered in dust and cobwebs, the hall looks like a gigantic       crypt.                                  MASTER MIND                 Good lord, man. You've only been                 dead for two months.              Master Mind walks, coming to a gigantic painted PORTRAIT OF       WAYNE SCOTT. He stops to reverently admire the image of his       fallen foe.                                                                  93.                                                 MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                  A disguise so simple, it's                  ingenious. No wonder I never caught                  on.              Besides the Armani suit, there's nothing to hide the fact       that this is the same person as Uberman. In the picture, he's       even standing in the same cheesy, heroic pose with his fists       on his hips.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                  Two lives, yet in both you were an                  ideal. Perhaps it was you who was                  victorious in the end, old friend.              A BONGING sound suddenly bellows through the dark halls.              Master Mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a       gigantic BOOKCASE.              On the twelfth bong it falls silent.              Master Mind begins to slide it across the floor until he       hears a loud CLICK.              The bookcase slides into the wall, REVEALING A HIDDEN       PASSAGE.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                  I'll miss how predictable you were.              The passage way leads Master Mind to a WORKING ESCALATOR.              Master Mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with       stone walls.              He begins to hear strange SOUNDS, almost like MUFFLED       SCREAMS, coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway.              Master Mind starts walking towards it. As he steps closer, he       begins to notice a light cracking through the bottom of the       door.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                  Hello? Anyone here...besides..all                  the BIG MEN who are with me now?              Nothing.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                      (to himself)                  What's the worst you're gonna find?                            (MORE)                                                                  94.                           MASTER MIND(cont'd)                 The man was a boy scout, not a                 serial killer.              He opens the door to his immediate amazement.              It's some kind of screening room. A PROJECTOR shoots an image       onto A DIRTY WHITE SCREEN hanging on the wall. BEER CANS       litter the floor; a table in front of a ripped-up couch is       covered in discarded snack goods; and a Kiss Pinball machine       stands in the far corner next to a CLOSED DOOR.              Master Mind turns his attention to the action on the screen.              SCREEN              A woman dressed in a leather DOMINATRIX OUTFIT is whipping an       overweight man lying on a swing-like device with his butt       sticking out.                                  DOMINATRIX IN FILM                 YOU ARE A WORM!              She whips him three times. The man CRIES out in pain.                                  FAT MAN IN FILM                 PINEAPPLE!!! PINEAPPLE!!!              Master Mind's eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery.              The door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open.              WAYNE SCOTT, dressed in raggedy sweats, steps into the room       carrying a CAN OF BEER and a bowl of JIFFY-POP.              Master Mind cannot believe his horrified eyes.                                   MASTER MIND                 Ahhhhhh!              Wayne Scott is just as startled.                                   WAYNE SCOTT                 Jesus!              He drop his drink and snack to the floor.              The two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain       their normal breathing patterns.              Wayne Scott walks over to the couch, brushes off a thick       layer of chip crumbs, and sits down.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)                 What the hell are you doing here?                                                                  95.                                                MASTER MIND                 I might just ask you the same                 question. I had thought I                 incinerated you.                                   WAYNE SCOTT                 You scared the bejesus out of me.                 How'd you figure out I was still                 alive? Wait, how do you know my                 identity!?                                  MASTER MIND                 Roxanne told me. As for your ruse,                 I forgot to line the bottom of the                 copper cage - Somebody pointed that                 out to me recently. Figured if they                 could do it, so could you. But one                 thing I couldn't figure out -                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 The skeleton? Something I                 \"borrowed\" from a medical school a                 few months before.                                  MASTER MIND                 A few months? How long had you been                 planning this?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I always planned to retire -                 eventually. I mean, come on, you                 can't do this sort of thing in your                 fifties. You'd just look                 ridiculous.              The pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in       Master Mind's head.                                  MASTER MIND                 I see it all so clearly now.              INT. MASTER MIND'S HYDROFOIL - FLASHBACK              Master Mind and his minions cover their eyes as the       observatory explodes.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)                 You must have done it just seconds                 before the observatory exploded.                                                                 96.                            INT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK              Similar to what Titan did, Uberman bores out from under the       cage.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)                 You bore out from under the cage.                 Then, using your Uber-Speed, -              EXT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK              Running in a blur-like haze, Uberman screeches to a halt in       front of some bushes.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)                 - you made your way to safety,                 where you had the skeleton safely                 hidden away somewhere.              EXT OBSERVATORY - SKY - DAY              Uberman soars high above the clouds. He looks down at the       observatory, which is a mere speck in the distance.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O) (CONT'D)                 Then you must have flown to a safe                 distance and waited for the                 explosion, then...              Just as the observatory explodes Uberman aims and throws the       SKELETON like a javelin.              It soars through the air like a missile, tearing through the       flames of the explosion, and crashing right into the       windshield of Master Mind's hydrofoil.              END OF FLASHBACK              Wayne stares at Master Mind, clearly impressed.                                  WAYNE                 Man, you ARE smart.                                   MASTER MIND                 But why fake your death? Why go                 through all of it? You could have                 just quit.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 But the responsibility would still                 be there.

WAYNE SCOTT(cont'd)                 A cop can retire and stop handing                 out speeding tickets - but people                 expect more from superheroes. I                 tell you, a volcano couldn't erupt                 in Zimbabwe without everyone                 expecting me to do something about                 it. I figured, out of sight, out of                 mind.                                   MASTER MIND                 And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to                 disappear?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Both of my lives have so much                 baggage. It's time for new baggage,                 you know?              Master Mind's is absolutely flabbergasted.                                  MASTER MIND                 I just can't believe it. This whole                 time you've been in hiding while a                 force of great evil is tearing your                 city apart?              Wayne rises to his feet, waving his hands for Master Mind to       say no more.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I don't want to hear about it.                 That's why I don't have a                 television in here to remind me of                 all the things I SHOULD be doing.                 Hell, I could get a wife to do                 that.                                  MASTER MIND                 There's a demented supervillain out                 there about to destroy our - I                 mean, your city.              Wayne shrugs indifferently.                                  MASTER MIND                 You're really going to do nothing?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Good and evil have a way of                 balancing themselves out. If this                 guy is as bad as you say, somebody                 will rise up to fight him. It's                 just the order of things. You found                 me, didn't you?                                                                 98.                            Wayne puts a condescending hand on Master Mind's shoulder.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)                 I know it's hard, but you'll find                 someone else someday.              He then starts walking to the door.                                  MASTER MIND                 You're the only one who can stop                 him.              Wayne turns around.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Couldn't if I wanted to. Gotta a                 plane to catch.                                    MASTER MIND                 A plane?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Going to Barbados for a little                 change in climate. Now, if you'll                 excuse me, I got to go pack.              He reads the still defeated look on Master Mind's face.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)                 You were a good foe. I'm sorry if                 I've let you down. If it makes a                 difference, you were the best foe a                 hero could ask for.                                  MASTER MIND                 Not smart enough to come up with a                 full-proof trap.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Well, you did almost have me when                 you figured out my weakness was                 copper. Now that made me sweat a                 little. Took me way too long to                 drill out from under that cage.                                  MASTER MIND                 I got lucky.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Anyway, it's a good thing for my                 sake that I could always count on                 you for an out.                                                               99.                                                MASTER MIND                     (suddenly confused)                 What do you mean?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 C'mon, we always threw each other a                 couple of bones. You would always                 leave me an out in one of your                 `full-proof' traps, and I'd never                 had you incarcerated at a                 penitentiary that you couldn't                 eventually escape from. It kept our                 little game going.              Master Mind seems deflated.                                  MASTER MIND                 Game? - Was that all this ever was                 to you? You know, I was trying my                 best every time I fought you. Those                 `outs' as you call them were                 unintentional.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Oh.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess I was never really a match                 for you, was I?              Wayne shrugs.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                     (thoughtfully)                 Then how can I expect to be one for                 Titan?              A beaten man, Master Mind heads for the door, but stops and       turns around.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 What about Roxanne?              Wayne unleashes an exhausted sigh.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I think we both got what we wanted                 out of our relationship. She got a                 career out of me, and I got plenty                 of other things out of her. But I'm                 ready to move on to greener                 pastures.                                                                 100.                            Master Mind's steel hand clinches into a fist at his side.       Wayne's oblivious to this.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess I wasn't the villain I                 thought I was, and you...you                 weren't the hero I thought you                 were.              He turns to make his exit when he suddenly sees ROXANNE       STANDING IN THE DOOR FRAME.              Wayne is almost at a loss for words.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Roxanne! How long have you been...                                  ROXANNE                 Long enough.              Roxanne looks at Master Mind.                                   ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 Don't you have something else you                 can go do?              Master Mind leaves Roxanne and Wayne facing each other in       silence.              EXT. ANOTHER BAR - DAY              Titan emerges with Brad and Frank. He's holding a BEER CAN       and a bag of PORK RINDS.                                  TITAN                 Alright, I want this whole thing to                 look ESPN professional, understand?              A distant MECHANIZED RUMBLE can be heard. The noise rises,       signaling the approach of something powerful.              Titan and his crew walk out to the center of the plaza as the       sound becomes almost deafening.              A TANK TRACK              as it moves over the street. We PULL BACK to see a whole line       of TANKS rolling along the street.              PLAZA              From the five streets branching off the plaza, a dozen tanks       roll toward Titan.                                                                 101.                            Titan turns to Brad and Frank.                                     TITAN (CONT'D)                    You guys are about to get some good                    footage. I might need a little                    room, though.              Brad and Frank look at each other and run to take cover       behind a nearby building.              Meanwhile, Titan nonchalantly sips from his beer as the tanks       begin to surround them.              FEEDBACK belts out of one of the tank's loudspeaker's,       causing Titan to do a mock wince.                                      TANK LOUDSPEAKER                    Titan, we have orders from the city                    of Metro to take you into custody.                    If you do not give your self up                    willingly, we will be forced to                    open fire.              There's a long pause as no one says anything.                                     TANK LOUDSPEAKER                    What is your answer?              Titan takes a sip of his beverage and UNLEASHES A GIGANTIC       BURP - The shockwave of which sends several of the tanks       flying into a nearby building.              Two of the remaining tanks close in on the villain. Both have       him dead to rights at point-blank range with their massive       guns.              Titan sets down his beer, then calmly plugs a fist into each       barrel.              They FIRE.              The FORCE OF THE BLAST SENDS THEM BOTH FLYING IN OPPOSITE       DIRECTIONS where they CRASH into nearby buildings.              Titan bends down and pick his beet back up.                                     TITAN                        (to beer)                    Miss me?              Titan is suddenly bombarded by a massive barrage of machine-       gun fire. The force sends him flying into the windshield of a       nearby car.                                                                 102.                            He looks up to see an APACHE ASSAULT COPTER. It's nose-       mounted GATLING-GUN is turning toward him.              Titan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can. The       bottom of it was blown apart in the blast.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Didn't mean to get you involved in                 all of this.              He stared daggers up at the helicopter pilot just as the gun       gets a bead on him.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Hey, man! You killed my suds!              Titan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his       hand.              It flies with so much force it knocks the helicopter blade       clean off. The rest of the Apache crashes to the street like       a car dropped off a building.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 That's one was for you, beer.              Titan salutes the wreckage and walks away to find Brad and       Frank still hiding behind the building.                                  TITAN                 Guys, please tell me you got that                 last bit.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Huh?                                  TITAN                 You're kidding me. I give you my                 sexiest moves and you mean to tell                 me it was for nothing?                                  BRAD HELMS                 We were afraid something might hit                 us.                                  TITAN                 Looks like I've given the story of                 the century to the wrong man.              He thinks about this for a moment, then it hits him.                                                              103.                                                TITAN                 Wait. What about that other                 reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on                 the topper half, but killer legs.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She's a                 much better reporter than I am. You                 want her.                                  TITAN                 Where can I find her.                                  FRANK                 We're actually not supposed to give                 out that sort of information.                                  BRAD HELMS                 1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe                 she lives in a penthouse.                                  TITAN                 You've been very helpful.              He tosses Brad over his shoulder like a discarded ice cream       cone.              In the faint distance we see him splash down in the middle of       the Metro City river.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY              Master Mind, pacing anxiously as Plato and Da Vinci pack       boxes. Obviously Master Mind is going on the lamb.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hurry, we must be on our way as                 soon as possible.                                  DA VINCI                 Master, why must we flee?                                  MASTER MIND                 I told you, Titan is too powerful.                 If he's set on destroying us,                 there's precious little we could do                 about it.                                  DA VINCI                 Where are we going?                                                              104.                                                MASTER MIND                 To another city, someplace with a                 shitload of superheroes to fight.                 We'll start over, we'll go back to                 doing what we do best.                                  PLATO                 With our tails between our legs?              The old Master Mind would never have let this comment slip       by, but as we have seen, he's not the same man.                                  MASTER MIND                 Plato, do you have a better plan?!              Master Mind's cell phone rings. He turns in shame from his       men and answers it.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Hello...Roxanne?              INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT              Roxanne paces back and forth on the phone.                                  ROXANNE                 What are you going to do about                 Tighten?              INTERCUT between Master Mind and Roxanne on phone.                                  MASTER MIND                 Right now I'm packing, later I'll                 have a snack on the train.                                  ROXANNE                 You're running away?                                  MASTER MIND                 In a word - yes.                                  ROXANNE                 You created this monster...                                  MASTER MIND                 I didn't create this - the god's of                 irony did and I am eating the crow                 I so richly deserve.                                  ROXANNE                 There's no time for self pity.                                                              105.

You'll be                 safe.                                  ROXANNE                 I'm not going anywhere.                                  MASTER MIND                 Will you listen to me, no one can                 stop him.                                   ROXANNE                 You have to try. The city needs                 your help.                                  MASTER MIND                 I'm afraid you have an inflated                 opinion of me.                                  ROXANNE                 What the hell's happened to you?                 The Master Mind I knew would never                 have run from a fight even though                 he knew deep in his heart that he                 didn't have a chance in hell of                 winning it. It was your best                 quality. You need to be that man                 right now...I...                                  MASTER MIND                 What?                                  ROXANNE                     (heart felt)                 I believe in you.              Master Mind is taken aback, in a good way. But he catches       himself before the words swell his heart.                                  MASTER MIND                 Sweet words, but that man is dead.                 Please, Roxanne, just come with me.                                  ROXANNE                 No...I guess you are a coward after                 all.              Suddenly, there's a loud crash.                                                                106.                            Roxanne looks up to see a huge hunk of her ceiling has been       completely ripped off.              Titan is flying above, holding the debris as casually as if       it were a paper plate at a barbecue.              He looks down at her and smiles.                                  TITAN                 Man, have I got a story for you.              Master Mind can hears Titan's familiar laugh from his side of       the line.                                  MASTER MIND                 Roxanne? Roxanne?              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              Titan is standing in front of the bowling alley, trying to       decide on an appropriate pose for the occasion.                                  TITAN                 What pose would be best? The corny                 folded arms thing?              He demonstrates, arching his chin proudly in the air.                                  TITAN                 Or maybe on the hips, like this.              It's the classic Superman pose, only not as masculine.                                  TITAN                 No, makes me look like a flamer                 pirate.              As Titan starts to fix his hair in the window, Frank pretends       to fix the lens on his camera as he speaks to Roxanne.                                  FRANK                     (whispering)                 Shouldn't we be making a run for it                 right about now?                                  ROXANNE                     (whispering)                 The guy can outrun bullets. I don't                 think either one of us is in that                 kind of shape.                                  TITAN                 She's right, Frank.                                                              107.                            Frank looks up, stunned that Titan could have possibly heard       him.                                  TITAN                 Also got super hearing. I promise                 not to keep the both of you long,                 but you'll thank me when this is                 all over.              Frank and Roxanne exchange helpless expressions.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY              Master Mind reverently stares up at the painted portrait of       his father.                                  MASTER MIND                 Dad, it's me...                     (he looks around to make                      sure no one can hear)                 ...Bubsy. I know we haven't talked                 in a while, and I'm sorry. It's                 been a little crazy trying to live                 up to a legacy.              The painting's menacing stare seems to reach into his very       soul.                                  MASTER MIND                 Anyway...You raised me to be the                 worst that I could possibly be. And                 I've tried to live up to that as                 best as I could - even dropping out                 of dentistry school like you wanted                 me to. But I'm about to do                 something now that would really                 piss you off. I'm going to go                 against everything you ever taught                 me. I hope...I hope that maybe                 you'll look down at what I'm about                 to do as not so much a good deed,                 but more like the outright defiance                 of a hateful and ungrateful, son.                 If you could do that, then maybe -                 in your own little way - you could -                 for probably the first time - find                 a reason to be proud of me.              He looks back up at the picture. Is it our imagination, or       does the painting's stare suddenly seem even angrier?                                                              108.                                                    MASTER MIND                    Well...either way, you're probably                    going to see me real soon.

TELEVISION              A news report shows an aerial shot of Titan setting the giant       ball down in the middle of a vacant city street.

The                    former hero knows as Titan is                    placing what appears to be a giant                    ball...              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY     - CONTINUOUS              Da Vinci stops in front of a television set, seeing the news       report in progress.                                     REPORTER                    Hold on...It appears our own                    Roxanne Ritchi is somehow at the                    scene. We now go to her with a live                    report.                                     DA VINCI                    Sir, I think you should see this!

CITY STREET - DAY              Roxanne is standing in front of a camera with a mike in her       hand.                                  ROXANNE                 I'm here with the cause of the                 destruction in Metro City. He has                 kidnapped me and a cameraman to                 chronicle what he refers to as the                 creation of a monument to his                 invincibility and overall                 \"Asskickiness.\" He will use this                 giant concrete bowling ball to play                 the largest game of bowling ever                 using the buildings of downtown                 Metro City as his pins.              Titan suddenly steps into the shot.                                  TITAN                 And I'm going for the biggest                 strike ever.              He leans into the camera.                                  TITAN                 And you, Metro City, have a                 ringside seat as I cement my name                 in the anal of history.

CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER              Titan holds up the massive bowling ball, lining up his shot.                                  TITAN                     (in quiet professional                      bowler announcer voice)                 Like Tiger before him, a young                 savior has come to raise a sport                 from the ashes. Rookie Hal Stewart,                 a young man with a dream, realizing                 that dream here today, folks.

TITAN(cont'd)                 One might click there heels and say                 \"There's no place like home\" upon                 finding themselves in such a                 fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much                 at home right were he is - with a                 ball in hand and glory in his                 sights.              INT. METRO CITY LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS              In the bowels of Master Mind's hideout, the HYDROGEN REACTOR       glows and HUMS MENACINGLY.              BACK TO SCENE              Roxanne just stand helpless as Frank films away.                                  ROXANNE                 Hal, I know everyone treated you                 like shit, but you don't have to do                 this.                                  TITAN                 You're right. I don't HAVE to do                 anything. Isn't that cool?              Titan lines up his shot.                                  TITAN                 Here's one for the record books!              Titan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main       street.              ROXANNE              Her face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable       destruction of Metro City.              As the ball rolls - it demolishes everything in it's wake;       cars, street lamps - windows shatter as the giant concrete       sphere brushes along side buildings.              TITAN              He smiles in anticipation and uses \"body English\" to direct       the ball.              GIANT BOWLING BALL POV              It's nearly halfway to its target.              ROXANNE                                                              111.                            She closes her eyes.              Titan's smile fades. He looks around as if he hears something       we don't.              About two hundred feet in front of the first building a GIANT       SPIDER WEB flies across the path of the ball, creating a       defensive barrier. An enormous letter \"M\" is etched in the       web's center.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 What the...?              The ball breaks through the web, but it's speed is greatly       reduced.                                  FRANK                 Look, what's that flying in the                 air?              We suddenly see MASTER MIND FLYING OVER THE ROLLING BALL IN A       JET PACK.              He quickly pulls out his goo gun and starts laying down a       path of sticky plasm to stop the destructive sphere's path.                                  MASTER MIND                 C'mon, slow down              Master Mind looks down to see the meter of the gun close to       empty.                                     MASTER MIND                 C'mon.              The ball slows drastically then starts rolling to the side.       It heads off an embankment and rolls harmlessly into a CANAL.                                  MASTER MIND                 Gutterball!              TITAN              He's furious to say the least.                                     TITAN                 YOU!              Master Mind gives him a mocking grin.                                  MASTER MIND                 Bowling? What other trailer park                 sports can you play?                                                                 112.                                                  TITAN                   You are becoming a real pain in my                   ass. I should have done this a long                   time ago.              Titan lunges at his tormentor. Master Mind hits the BOOSTER       on his jet pack and heads back toward the other side of the       city with Titan in hot pursuit.                                    MASTER   MIND (CONT'D)                       (into walkie   talkie)                   Plato, Da Vinci.   Secure Roxanne,                   he's falling for   it.              ELSEWHERE              A flustered Titan lands. He begins searching the city       streets, but Master Mind is nowhere in sight.              He turns upon hearing an EEKING sound to his left.              Sitting on the ground is a CHIMPANZEE wearing a strange       collar. It smiles at him.                                    TITAN                   What the hell?              From behind, Titan is immediately set upon by five more RADIO       CONTROLLED APES.                                      TITAN (CONT'D)                   GODAMNIT!              The critters bite hop and hit Titan. As soon as he throws one       off two more jump him.              Titan breaks free and with his mighty breath blows them       across the street into a fruit stand. With Titan out of their       sight they begin to attack the fruit.              MASTER MIND              He's a block away frantically hitting his remote.                                    MASTER MIND                   Shit! Stupid monkeys and their                   fruit.              Titan flies away from the mad monkeys and lands to find       Master Mind sitting on the ground wrapped in a long cape with       only his head sticking out.                                                              113.                                                TITAN (CONT'D)                 No more games.              Titan FIRES HIS LASER VISION AT MASTER MIND's CHEST.              Master Mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a FIRE HYDRANT.       Titan's EYE LASERS burn through the hydrant releasing a high       pressure stream of water.              Master Mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of       CEMENT mix into the truck.              The crowd, police and news crews move in closer when Titan       doesn't emerge.              Master Mind drops his last remote and walks toward the truck       cautiously.                                  MASTER MIND                 Could it really be that easy--              - BOOM - The back of the truck explodes, throwing dust and       concrete everywhere. When the dust clears we see and enraged       Titan.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Didn't think so.              As the villain walks toward him, he pulls back his fist to       give Master Mind the killing blow.                                  TITAN                 If you don't mind, I'm going to                 punch trough your face now.              Preparing himself for the end, Master Mind shuts his eyes as       a SUDDEN GUST OF WIND BEGINS TO PICK UP.              AS Titan goes to strike, a BLURRY FIGURE RUNS IN AND SNATCHES       MASTER MIND OUT OF THE AWAY.              Stunned, Master Mind begins to feel around his body as if to       make sure everything's still in place.                                     MASTER MIND                 I'm alive.              He turns to see UBERMAN standing next to him.                                     MASTER MIND                 Uberman?                                                              114.                            The terrified bystanders start to notice the figure standing       next to Master Mind.                                  BYSTANDER 1                 It's Uberman!                                  BYSTANDER 2                 Uberman's alive!                                  BYSTANDER 3                 We're saved!              As the CROWD CHEERS, A confused Master Mind turns to Metro       City's newly resurrected champion.                                     MASTER MIND                 I thought.                                     UBERMAN                 So did I.              He puts a hand on Master Mind's shoulder.                                  UBERMAN                 Thank you, old enemy.                                     MASTER MIND                 For what?                                  UBERMAN                 Showing me the error of my ways,                 Showing me I'm meant to be this                 city's savior, showing me that,                 while we can try, there is no                 running away from our true destiny.              With that, UBERMAN IS STRICKEN BY A LASER BLAST, INSTANTLY       TURNING HIM INTO A CHARRED HUMAN SKELETON.              Master Mind turns to see Titan smiling with his STILL SMOKING       EYES.                                  TITAN                 Oh...Did I interrupt something?              Master Mind turns to run, but, suddenly Titan is before him.                                  TITAN                 Where you going, buddy?              Titan grabs Master Mind by the collar and throws him across       the street into a parked car.                                                                 115.                                                TITAN (CONT'D)                 Welcome to Paintown. Population:                 you.              Master Mind manages to stand on shaky legs. He seems in a       daze, unable to move.              Titan flies up in the air.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Time to finish this.              With his fist front and center, Titan speeds toward Master       Mind. He's like a human torpedo, coming in for the killing       blow.              Master Mind comes to his senses and puts up his hands.                                  MASTER MIND                 WAIT!!!              Titan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like       an old Warner Bros cartoon.                                  TITAN                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 Quick joke - What's the capital of                 Thailand?                                  TITAN                 Huh - I don't know.                                  MASTER MIND                 It's bang cock!              In a sudden surge of strength, MASTER MIND PUNCHES TITAN IN       THE GROIN.              The once mighty man instantly drops to his knees, searching,       with tears in his eyes, for the proper word to express the       pain suddenly surging through his member.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Ow.              Baffled, he looks up at Master Mind's hand and sees his       gauntlet is now made ENTIRELY OUT OF COPPER.                                   MASTER MIND                 So, I guess pennies are good for                 something.                                                              116.                            He punches Titan in the face, knocking him out cold.              Master Mind looks down on Titan with more than a little       pride. Suddenly he hears something behind him. He spins to       see the crowd making a strange noise - APPLAUSE.              Roxanne comes up to him.              The crowd starts to go wild and cheers for Master Mind. He's       not sure what to make of it.                                  ROXANNE                 Pretty strange, huh?                                  MASTER MIND                 They're cheering for me.                                  ROXANNE                 You saved them. You saved                 everybody. How's it feel?              Master Mind looks at the smiles all around him. He begins to       well up a little.                                  MASTER MIND                 It's a...it's nice, you know? I                 usually don't get a lot of                 feedback.                     (whispering)                 But I also kind of caused all this.                 What happens when they find that                 out I was the cause of some of                 this?              Roxanne looks at the cheering crowd, then back at Master       Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 What they don't know won't hurt                 them.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess that is all in the past.                                  ROXANNE                 You're the hero.                                  MASTER MIND                 I don't think I'd go that far...I                 mean I just...er...                                  ROXANNE                 Master Mind?                                                              117.                                                   MASTER MIND                    Yes?                                     ROXANNE                    Stop talking.              She kisses him.              The crowd erupts in a cheer.              TELEVISION              The channel 7 he channel 7 logo zooms in followed by the       title \"Eye on Metro City.\"              A picture of Master Mind smiling appears on the screen behind       her.                                     SAMANTHA SUMMERS                    Who's bad? Well, not Master Mind.                    It seems the former villain has                    done a career 180 after defeating                    Tighten and saving Metro City from                    certain enslavement. And here he is                    getting a full pardon by Metro                    City's Mayor, Steve Dent.              Cut to ceremony on capital steps. The MAYOR is shaking Master       Mind's metal gauntlet when it suddenly STARTS TO CRUSH HIS       HAND.                                     MAYOR                    Ahhh!              Secret service men quickly start to draw their weapons and       take aim at Master Mind.              Realizing what's happening, he quickly lets the mayor's hand       go and puts his arms in the air.                                     MASTER MIND                    Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit.              He elbows the mayor.                                     MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                     We're okay, right?              Wincing, the mayor signals the men to put their guns down.              WE CUT to video of Titan behind bars in a regular prison.                                                              118.                                                BRAD HELMS                 And what about Tighten? Is there a                 prison in existence that can hold                 this super powered menace? Well,                 the answer we found is no.              A man in a white lab coat stands in front of Titan's cell       just out of reach.                                  PRISON SCIENTIST                 Of course normally he could break                 out of there anytime, but as you                 can see we've taken some special                 precautions.              The news camera pans over see Titan in his cell wearing a       copper JOCK STRAP with electrical cables hooked to it.              Back to Samantha at the desk.                                  BRAD HELMS                 What is a Hero? It seems never has                 that question needed to be asked                 more than it does tonight. We go to                 our very own Roxanne Ritchi, making                 her triumphant return to our news                 desk for the answer.              Brad turns. The camera pans over to Roxanne who we now see       has been sitting beside him.                                  ROXANNE                 What is a hero? Well, there are                 many different kinds. There are                 those who hear a call, like the                 policeman or doctor, then there's                 the kind the public creates in                 their search for meaning and hope.                 Then, there are those who have the                 courage to change.              DARK ALLEY - NIGHT              A woman is being chased by two large thugs. They're gaining       on her.              She comes to a brick wall - a dead end.              The thugs laugh.                                  THUG #1                 Hey, gimme that purse?                                                              119.                                                MASTER MIND (O.S)                 I don't think it would go with your                 outfit.              The thugs turn around to see Master Mind, standing with his       arms folded across his chest.                                  THUG #2                 It's Master Mind!              Thug #1 draws a knife.                                  THUG #1                 So? It's not like he has any                 superpowers.              Thug #1 puts his fingers to his mouth and whistles.              Suddenly two more Thugs appear behind Master Mind.                                   MASTER MIND                 I'm gonna give you a chance to                 surrender.                                  THUG #1                 Four against one. For a Master                 Mind, you're really bad at math.              Master Mind throws a hand signal up in the air.              Suddenly a giant robotic foot crashes down on the two men       behind him.              Thug #1 and Thug #2 drop their knives and raise their hands       in the air.              Master Mind looks up and waves.                                  MASTER MIND                 Way to take out those two goons,                 guys!              We see Da Vinci and Plato at the wheel of a gigantic robot.                                  DA VINCI                 What two goons?              The giant robot lifts its foot to check the bottom of it's       sole. It KNOCKS OVER WATER TOWER in the process.              The woman looks at Master Mind, horrified.                                             120.                                                MASTER MIND                     (apologetically)                 Sorry, we're new at this.

More importantly, you\nwon't have to learn yet another DSL. Shoestrap aims to get out of your way.\n\nYou should be able to get up and running in minutes, not hours.\n\n\n## What about Chef, Puppet and co.?\n\nChef and Puppet are great tools, but they are too complex for most use cases.\nThe learning curve for these tools is quite steep as they each have their own\nDSL. On the other end, Shoestrap is just Bash. It does not require any\n'Bash to config files' translation.\n\nI believe Shoestrap is a great simple alternative to Chef or Puppet that will\nfulfill the needs of most people.\n\n\n## Terminology\n\nShoestrap uses some of the Chef terminology since I couldn't come up with\nbetter names or analogies.\n\n### Cookbook\n\nA cookbook is a Bash script that executes different actions. For example,\nit may install packages, run 'recipes'. Think of it as a dispatcher.\n\nCookbooks live at the root of your Shoestrap project. You can have multiple\ncookbooks per project.\n\n### Recipes\n\nRecipes are snippets of Bash code that can be executed from a Cookbook. For\nexample, you may have a recipe to install `memcached`, or a recipe to setup\nSSH keys on the target machine. Remember, it's just Bash, so anything goes.\n\n### Assets\n\nAn asset is a file that will be needed by the target machine. For example,\na configuration file or an init script.\n\n\n## Helpers\n\nShoestrap ships with many Bash helpers functions. They can be found in\n`helpers\/default`. You do NOT need to use the built-in helper functions,\nbut they will simplify many of the most common tasks you'll need to perform.\n\nHelper functions can be used from cookbooks or recipes. You may also pass\narguments to these functions.\n\nYou may add your own helper functions in `helpers\/custom`.\n\nHere are some of the most commonly used helpers:\n\n#### `add_line`\nConcatenate a line to a text file if it's not already there.\n\n#### `add_user`\nAdd a user to the system.\n\n#### `copy`\nCopy an asset file. It first looks in the assets\/{cookbook} directory and falls back to assets\/default if file doesn't exist.\n\n#### `error`\nWrite an error to the screen and halt execution.\n\n#### `is_installed`\nCheck if an element has already been installed. Useful to prevent code from running more than once. Also see `set_installed`.\n\n#### `log`\nWrite a line to the screen.\n\n#### `package`\nInstall a package (ie: apt-get install {package-name}).\n\n#### `package_update`\nUpdate packages in package manager (ie: apt-get update).\n\n#### `recipe`\nRun a recipe. It first looks in the recipes\/{cookbook} directory and falls back to recipes\/default if file doesn't exist.\n\n#### `set_installed`\nSets an element as 'installed'.\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1.  Clone the `shoestrap` repo to your local machine.\n    `git clone https:\/\/github.com\/cmer\/shoestrap.git`\n\n2.  Rename `.\/my-cookbook` to something a little bit more meaningful. For example,\n    you might want to call your cookbook `web` if it bootstraps a web server. Make\n    sure it is executable (`chmod +x {my-cookbook}`).\n\n3.  Specify actions to take in the cookbook. For example, which recipes to run, which\n    packages to install or which user(s) to add. For example: `recipe 'nginx'`.\n\n4.  Create a recipe file under `recipes\/default`. For example: `recipes\/default\/nginx`. The recipe\n    is the code to execute. In our example, it would be the code to run to install `nginx`.\n\n5.  Add assets (if needed) under `assets\/default\/{recipe}`. For example: `assets\/default\/nginx\/nginx.conf`.\n\n6.  Upload your project to the target machine. You can use `scp`, Capistrano, Git or whatever you feel\n    comfortable with.\n\n7.  Run your cookbook from the target machine. For example: `sudo .\/web`.\n\n\n## Example\n\nYou can see a sample project at http:\/\/github.com\/cmer\/shoestrap-example\n\nBrowse the source code, it's the best way to familiarize yourself with Shoestrap. It's also a great starting\npoint for your own Shoestrap project.\n\n\n## Example: Directory Structure of a Shoestrap Project\n\n    [assets]\n      [default]            # Assets to be used by default\n        [recipe1]          # Assets for 'recipe1'.\n          foo.conf\n          bar.conf\n      [cookbook1]          # Assets for 'cookbook1'. If asset cannot be found here, fallback is 'default'\n        [recipe1]          # Assets for 'recipe1' when executed from 'cookbook1'. Overrides anything in [default].\n          foo.conf\n    [helpers]\n      custom               # Your custom Bash functions and helpers\n      default              # Shoestrap's default helpers\n      initialize           # Initialize script.\n    [recipes]\n      [default]            # Recipes to be used by default\n        recipe1\n        recipe2\n        recipe3\n      [cookbook1]          # Recipes for 'cookbook1'. Overrides anything in [default].\n        recipe1\n    cookbook1              # The cookbook script itself. This is your point of entry to Shoestrap\n\n\n## Compatibility\n\nShoestrap has only been tested with Ubuntu Oneiric 11.10 but should work with any\/most Unix-like\noperating systems. My goal is to support Ubuntu\/Debian, CentOS\/Red Hat and Mac OS X. I will need\nhelp from the community to achieve this, however.\n","32":"# Public Speaking without Barfing on Your Shoes\n\n* Get the latest slides at [SpeakerDeck](https:\/\/speakerdeck.com\/reverentgeek)\n* [About me](https:\/\/about.me\/reverentgeek) | [reverentgeek.com](http:\/\/reverentgeek.com) | Twitter: [@reverentgeek](https:\/\/twitter.com\/reverentgeek)\n\n## Recording of this Presentation\n\n* [Nodevember 2016](https:\/\/youtu.be\/aPSvHT9USO8)\n\n## My Articles\n\n* [Captivate Your Audience Using Simple Illustrations](https:\/\/medium.com\/@reverentgeek\/captivate-your-audience-using-simple-illustrations-5bf0fcd0e301)\n* [5 Essential Ingredients for an Awesome Tech Talk](https:\/\/medium.com\/@reverentgeek\/5-essential-ingredients-for-an-awesome-tech-talk-2e5778b2cb5a)\n* [Please, Give Public Speaking a Try](https:\/\/medium.com\/@reverentgeek\/please-give-public-speaking-a-try-c90c539012d5)\n\n## Recommended Books\n\n* \"[Show and Tell](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Show-Tell-Everybody-Extraordinary-Presentations\/dp\/1591848024)\" by Dan Roam\n* \"[Ted Talks: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/TED-Talks-Official-Public-Speaking\/dp\/0544634497)\" by Chris Anderson\n* \"[Do You Talk Funny? 7 Comedy Habits to Become a Better (and Funnier) Public Speaker](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Do-You-Talk-Funny-Funnier\/dp\/1942952279)\" by David Nihill\n* \"[Confessions of a Public Speaker](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Confessions-Public-Speaker-Scott-Berkun-ebook\/dp\/B002VL1CGM)\" by Scott Berkun\n* \"[The Storyteller's Spellbook](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Storytellers-Spellbook-compelling-career-magical-ebook\/dp\/B073Q5X4BX\/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1500314737&sr=1-3&keywords=james+whittaker): How to make your ideas more compelling and your career more magical\" by James Whittaker\n\n## Recommended Articles\n\n* [What if they start laughing at me? 10 fears I face as a public speaker](https:\/\/medium.com\/@saraford\/what-if-they-start-laughing-at-me-10-fears-i-face-as-a-public-speaker-83fe18de7b39#.z7114xz9h) by Sara Ford\n* [Speaker Starter Kit](https:\/\/github.com\/coryhouse\/speaker-starter-kit) by Cory House\n* [How to Prepare: a Checklist for Great Talks](http:\/\/scottberkun.com\/2011\/speakers-checklist\/) by Scott Berkun\n* [Meet the next Code Camp Speaker: You!](http:\/\/jeremybytes.blogspot.com\/2011\/08\/meet-next-code-camp-speaker-you.html) by Jeremy Clark\n* [You Aren't Instantly Awesome, But You Can Get Better with Practice](https:\/\/jeremybytes.blogspot.com\/2015\/10\/you-arent-instantly-awesome-but-you-can.html) by Jeremy Clark\n* [The best advice I can give on public speaking](https:\/\/medium.com\/desk-of-van-schneider\/my-best-advice-i-can-give-about-public-speaking-61c6fab92192#.jcy8hf7wo) by Tobias van Schneider\n* [How I prepared for the NDC keynote (and other speaker tips)](https:\/\/www.troyhunt.com\/how-i-prepared-for-the-ndc-keynote-and-other-speaker-tips\/) by Troy Hunt\n* [Speaker style bingo: 10 presentation anti-patterns](https:\/\/www.troyhunt.com\/speaker-style-bingo-10-presentation\/) by Troy Hunt\n* [Notes on \"Confessions of a Public Speaker\"](https:\/\/sivers.org\/book\/ConfessionsPublicSpeaker) by Derek Sivers\n\n## Toastmasters\n\nFind your local [Toastmasters](https:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/) club!\n\n> Do you want to become a confident public speaker and strong leader?

This repo remains here as a simple example of how to use Selenium to make an automated purchase bot. This code is no longer maintained. Please do not DM me to improve this code, you will be on your own.**\n\n*NOTE: This program is made for Python 2.7.X and will not work with Python 3.X.X!*\n\nThis is a simple Python bot which uses Selenium to navigate the website [http:\/\/www.nakedcph.com\/](http:\/\/www.nakedcph.com\/)  and quickly checkout shoe orders. Although the script was written with the specific intention of making shoe orders, there is nothing stopping users from checking out other items on the site through the script. Users can configure how many orders they want to make, including the credit card info to use and various items to checkout within each order by editing the included checkout.conf JSON file. The script is configured to use the PhantomJS headless webdriver, which is included as a NodeJS dependency. Chromedriver is also included as a dependency in the case that you don't want to use a headless webdriver.\n\n## Installation Instructions (Linux\/Mac)\n\n1. Make sure that you have Python 2.7.X installed, along with Pip.\n\n2. Install Node.js and NPM.\n\n3. Download or clone this repository to a directory on your machine.\n\n4. Add the directory containing this project into your global PYTHONPATH environment variable. *NOTE: If you get an error stating that checkout.conf cannot be found, or that it contains invalid JSON, but the JSON in checkout.conf is correct, you may not have performed this step.*\n\n5. Open the terminal, navigate to the project directory, and type the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This should install the Python dependencies Selenium and Chromedriver. *NOTE: On Mac, the dependency chromedriver-installer may not download. If this is the case, you will have to install Chromedriver manually.*\n\n6. From the terminal, type the command `npm install`. This should install PhantomJS.\n\n7. Edit the checkout.conf JSON file to your liking, but make sure that it still contains valid JSON syntax.\n\n8. You may edit autocheckout.py to use Chromedriver instead of PhantomJS if you wish to view the browser navigation performed by the script. \n\n9. Run the program from the terminal with `python autocheckout.py`. *NOTE: If the checkout process does not complete properly and the program crashes (not including JSON errors, see instruction number 4 for those), then that means that one of two things occurred: Either the site did not have the desired quantity of a particular item in your order, or the website's HTML has been updated since the writing of this script. If the latter is true, then you can try commenting out the alternate code section in the script, and uncommenting the default code section. Please refer to the comments in the script for finding these sections. If neither of the code sections work, then the HTML hardcoded into this script may be outdated. Feel free to modify the HTML in the script to fit your needs. If you wish to debug the script further, you can comment out the PhantomJS driver initialization in the script, and uncomment the Chromedriver initialization to view the browser's progress in real time.*\n\n## Installation Instructions (Windows)\n\nThis script has not been tested for Windows, but it should still work if a similar procedure is followed as the one for Linux\/Mac.\n","39":"# nike-shoes-landing-page\n Make Animated Nike Shoes Landing Page with only HTML, CSS & pure JS\n\n## Video\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/5qg4rpD-OX4\n\n![\"Make Animated Nike Shoes Landing Page with only HTML, CSS & pure JS\"](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/trananhtuat\/nike-shoes-landing-page\/main\/Screenshot_1.png \"Make Animated Nike Shoes Landing Page with only HTML, CSS & pure JS\")\n\n![\"Make Animated Nike Shoes Landing Page with only HTML, CSS & pure JS\"](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/trananhtuat\/nike-shoes-landing-page\/main\/Screenshot_2.png \"Make Animated Nike Shoes Landing Page with only HTML, CSS & pure JS\")\n\n![\"Make Animated Nike Shoes Landing Page with only HTML, CSS & pure JS\"](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/trananhtuat\/nike-shoes-landing-page\/main\/Screenshot_3.png \"Make Animated Nike Shoes Landing Page with only HTML, CSS & pure JS\")","40":"===\nped\n===\n\n.. image:: https:\/\/badgen.net\/pypi\/v\/ped\n  :alt: pypi badge\n  :target: https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/ped\/\n\n.. image:: https:\/\/dev.azure.com\/sloria\/sloria\/_apis\/build\/status\/sloria.ped?branchName=master\n  :alt: Build Status\n  :target: https:\/\/dev.azure.com\/sloria\/sloria\/_build\/latest?definitionId=18&branchName=master\n\n.. image:: https:\/\/badgen.net\/badge\/code%20style\/black\/000\n   :target: https:\/\/github.com\/ambv\/black\n   :alt: Code style: Black\n\nQuickly open Python modules in your text editor.\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ ped django\n    $ ped django.core.urlresolvers\n    $ ped django.views.generic.TemplateView\n\n    # Partial name matching\n    $ ped django.http.resp\n    Editing django.http.response...\n    ...Done.\n\n    # Specify which editor to use\n    $ PED_EDITOR=vim ped django.shortcuts\n\n\n``ped`` will find your modules in the currently-active virtual environment.\n\n\nGet it now\n**********\n\nFrom PyPI:\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install ped\n\n\nOr, run it with `pipx <https:\/\/github.com\/pipxproject\/pipx>`_:\n\n::\n\n    $ pipx run ped --help\n\n\nChanging the default editor\n***************************\n\n``ped`` will try to use your favorite text editor.

The project page lives [here](https:\/\/rileyshaw.com\/tappy).\n\n## Installation\nTappy can be installed using [npm](https:\/\/www.npmjs.org\/package\/tappy), [bower](http:\/\/bower.io\/), or included from [jsdelivr](http:\/\/cdn.jsdelivr.net\/tappy\/latest\/mainfile):\n```bash\nnpm install tappy\n```\n```bash\nbower install tappy\n```\n```html\n<script src=\"\/\/cdn.jsdelivr.net\/tappy\/latest\/mainfile\"><\/script>\n```\n\nThe library uses a [universal module definition](https:\/\/github.com\/umdjs\/umd), so it _should_ work with whatever system you're using.\n\n## Usage\nFor current docs, please visit [the project page](https:\/\/rileyjshaw.com\/tappy).\n\n## Contributing\nPull-requests to the `\/app` and `\/test` directories are welcome. Please create an [issue](https:\/\/github.com\/rileyjshaw\/tappy\/issues) if you plan on adding features, as it might be better suited to a plugin.\n\nPlease squash changes down to a single commit before making a pull-request.\n\n### Building the library\nIf you don't have [gulp](http:\/\/gulpjs.com\/), you'll have to install it:\n```bash\nnpm install -g gulp\n```\n\nAfter running\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\nin the main directory, running\n```bash\ngulp\n```\nwill watch the `\/app` directory and build any changes to `\/dist`. It also runs changes through `test\/test.js`.\n\n### Style\nPull requests _must_ adhere to the following code style guidelines, influenced heavily by [idiomatic.js](https:\/\/github.com\/rwaldron\/idiomatic.js\/):\n\n - Put a space before the parens following `if ()`, `else if ()`, `for ()`, `while ()`, `try ()`, and `function ()` statements. Do not add padding spaces _within_ these parens.\n - Put a space between closing braces `)` and opening curly braces `{`.\n - Add padding spaces to curly braces that self-close on a single line: `var littleObject = { name: 'tiny' };`. Empty object literals do not require a space: `{}`.\n - Function definitions go at the top of their scope, followed immediately by `var`s.\n - If multiple lines are required for variable declarations, each new line should have its own `var` statement.\n - Indent using tabs. No trailing whitespace.\n - Line-length limit of 80 characters, with a tab-width of 4.\n - If statements have to be broken across lines, end lines with an operator:\n```javascript\n\/\/ example\nvar reallyReallyReallyLongLine = 'Zero Cool' + ', Acid Burn' + ', Lord Nikon' +\n    \t', The Phantom Phreak' + ', Cereal Killer' + ', The Plague' +\n    \t', that other kid...';\n```\n - When aligning statements across lines, use spaces if alignment should be locked to a specific character length. in the previous example, four spaces were used _before_ the indenting tab to ensure tabs always started after `var `.\n - Gulp will automatically lint everything through jshint.

The shoes function like a treadmill where as you walk you stay i the same location. With a treadmill you can only walk forward and backward, but with the vr shoes you can turn, walk, and strafe in any direction.\n\nThe the vr shoes, along with a vr headset and saftey harness, are intended to be used while playing a vr game so that you can walk infintely in the game while staying in the same spot physically.\n\nThe design file is for [DesignSpark Mechanical](https:\/\/www.rs-online.com\/designspark\/mechanical-software).\n\nI have three BOMs listed. BOM-Prototype-Dev-Pro is the BOM for the prototype\/development version I'm working on now. In the future it could be a pro version. BOM-Consumer is the BOM for the version of the shoe that has cheaper components that might be more suitable for a consumer-level product. BOM-OnlyPoweredBraking is the BOM for a downgraded version of the shoe that only has powered braking and no powered walking assistance.\n\nI'm currently working on the prototype version. Once I have a prototype working I will work on getting the cheaper (BOM-Consumer) version working. Then later I can try the powered braking version. I will also try out other versions of the shoes, such as a cheaper version that can only go forward\/backwards (no strafing).\n\nFor more information, please visit [this page](http:\/\/evansalex.com\/2020\/08\/04\/a-motorized-shoe-to-be-used-with-virtual-reality-games-part-3\/).\n\n","44":"\u4ec0\u4e48\u9b3c\uff01\n======\n\n###\u6982\u8ff0\n\nShenmeGUI\u662f\u4e00\u5957\u53d7[Shoes](http:\/\/shoesrb.com\/)\u542f\u53d1\u800c\u8bde\u751f\u7684GUI\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u62e5\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684DSL\u8bed\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528HTML\u6784\u5efa\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u524d\u540e\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fbf\u6377\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684GUI\u5e94\u7528\u3002\n\n###\u5b89\u88c5\n\n\u6267\u884c `gem install shenmegui` \u3002\n\n###\u793a\u4f8b\u4ee3\u7801\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'shenmegui'\n\nShenmeGUI.app do\n  form(title: 'Main Form') do\n    button('alert').onclick{ alert 'Hello World!' }\n    button('open an image').onclick do\n      path = get_open_file_name\n      @t.text = path\n      @i.src = path\n    end\n    stack do\n      label 'image path:'\n      @t = textarea 'http:\/\/s.amazeui.org\/media\/i\/demos\/bw-2014-06-19.jpg', width: '100%'\n      @t.oninput{ @i.src = this.text }\n    end\n    @i = image @t.text\n    @p = progress(75)\n    button('+').onclick { @p.percent += 5 }\n    button('-').onclick { @p.percent -= 5 }\n  end\n\n  form(title: 'Radiobox & Checkbox') do\n    options = %w{option1 option2 option3}\n    arr = []\n    arr << select(options)\n    arr << radio(options, arrange: 'horizontal')\n    arr << checkbox(options, checked: options[1])\n    arr.each{|x| x.onchange{ alert this.checked } }\n  end\n\n  form(title: 'Table') do\n    @table = table([[1,2], [3,4]]).tap do |t|\n      t.column_names = ['x', 'y']\n      t.row_names_enum = (1..Float::INFINITY).to_enum\n    end\n    flow do\n      @x = textline 'new x', width: '60px'\n      @y = textline 'new y', width: '60px'\n    end\n    button('add row').onclick{ @table << [@x.text, @y.text]}\n    button('remove row').onclick { @table.data.pop }\n  end\n\nend\n\nShenmeGUI.open_browser\nShenmeGUI.start!\n```\n\n\u5c06\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5982\u56fe\u6240\u793a\u7684\u754c\u9762\uff1a\n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/CicholGricenchos\/ShenmeGUI\/static\/ShenmeGUI_example20150713.png)\n\n###\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u6c42\n\nRuby\u7248\u672c\u5927\u4e8e\u7b49\u4e8e2.0.0\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u4e3a\u524d\u540e\u7aef\u901a\u8baf\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86websocket\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u652f\u6301websocket\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u3002\n\n\u76ee\u524d\u6253\u5f00\u6587\u4ef6\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6846\u53ea\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86windows\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5728Linux\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528\u4f1a\u7ed9\u51fa\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u9664\u6b64\u4e4b\u5916\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6ca1\u6709\u8981\u6c42\u3002\n\n###wiki\n\n\u4e86\u89e3\u66f4\u591a\u8bf7\u9605\u89c8[wiki](https:\/\/github.com\/CicholGricenchos\/ShenmeGUI\/wiki)\u3002","45":"# [gulp](http:\/\/gulpjs.com\/), [browserify](http:\/\/browserify.org\/), [node-sass](https:\/\/github.com\/andrew\/node-sass)\/[Bourbon](http:\/\/bourbon.io\/), [React](http:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react\/index.html) and [shoe](https:\/\/github.com\/substack\/shoe) playground\n\n## Why?\n\nI wanted to play with some newer stuff. So I decided to have a look at the \"newest\" contenders in the web dev playground.\n\n## What?\n\n* [gulp](http:\/\/gulpjs.com\/) the streaming task runner for node. Previously I used [grunt](http:\/\/gruntjs.com\/) and it is great. But there is one problem ... it gets really slow with bigger problems. Especially in combination with [sass](http:\/\/sass-lang.com\/)\/[compass](http:\/\/compass-style.org\/).\n* [browserify](http:\/\/browserify.org\/) allows you to use node.js-style requires in the browser and [npm](https:\/\/npmjs.org\/) as the package manager. For me it is easier to use than [require.js](http:\/\/requirejs.org\/) because of a much simpler configuration.\n* [node-sass](https:\/\/github.com\/andrew\/node-sass) uses [libSass](http:\/\/libsass.org\/) to process sass\/scss files into css. Because it is written in node.js and uses the c bindings it is much faster than the ruby [sass](http:\/\/sass-lang.com\/) executable.\n* [Bourbon](http:\/\/bourbon.io\/) is a mixing library for sass which is much simpler and more lightweight than [compass](http:\/\/compass-style.org\/) but also has the most stuff I need.\n* [React](http:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react\/index.html) is a library for building user interfaces that uses a virtual DOM diff implementation for higher performance.\n* [shoe](https:\/\/github.com\/substack\/shoe) is a library to use streams over [sockjs](https:\/\/github.com\/sockjs\/sockjs-node). I used it to replace ajax request. Just for fun ...\n\n## Source code\n\nYou can find the source code on [github](https:\/\/github.com\/aslansky\/react-stack-playground).\n\n## Learnings\n\n* [gulp](http:\/\/gulpjs.com\/) is great. The one thing that makes it more useful than grunt for me is the configuration that is done in pure javascript. No ~~obscure~~ complex configuration object like in grunt. To define a task you just need to create code like this:\n\n  ```\n  gulp.task('styles', function () {\n    return gulp.src('.\/src\/scss\/main.scss')\n      .pipe(sass({\n        outputStyle: gulp.env.production ? 'compressed' : 'expanded',\n        includePaths: ['.\/src\/scss'].concat(bourbon),\n        errLogToConsole: gulp.env.watch\n      }))\n      .pipe(gulp.dest('.\/dist\/css'));\n  });\n  ```\n  Also because of the use of streams gulp seems to be much faster than grunt. The only upside I could see at the time is the lack of plugins. The grunt ecosystem of plugin is bigger and more mature.\n  You can find more on grunt vs gulp [here](http:\/\/www.shaundunne.com\/gulp-is-the-new-black\/).\n\n * [browserify](http:\/\/browserify.org\/) is awesome. Together with npm you get a nice package management system that just works without much configuration. Also the use of module.exports and require in a node.js way for me looks cleaner than the amd syntax of [require.js](http:\/\/requirejs.org\/). To get started you just need to have a package.json and a task in your gulpfile.js\n\n   ```\n   \"dependencies\": {\n     \"react\": \"~0.8.0\",\n     \"showdown\": \"aslansky\/showdown\",\n     \"shoe\": \"0.0.15\"\n   }\n   ```\n   ```\n   gulp.task('scripts', function() {\n     return gulp.src('.\/src\/js\/app.js', {read: false})\n       .pipe(browserify({\n         insertGlobals : false,\n         transform: ['reactify'],\n         extensions: ['.jsx'],\n         debug: !gulp.env.production\n       }))\n       .pipe(gulpif(gulp.env.production, uglify({\n         mangle: {\n           except: ['require', 'export', '$super']\n         }\n       })))\n       .pipe(gulp.dest('.\/dist\/js'));\n   });\n   ```\n   After that you can start using require in your javascript.\n\n   ```\n   var React = require('react');\n   var CommentBox = require('.\/jsx\/comment-box');\n   ```\n   or write modules with module.exports\n\n   ```\n   \/** @jsx React.DOM *\/\n   'use strict';\n\n   var React = require('react\/addons');\n   var Comment = require('.\/comment');\n   var ReactTransitionGroup = React.addons.TransitionGroup;\n\n   module.exports = React.createClass({\n     render: function() {\n       var commentNodes = this.props.data.map(function (comment, i) {\n         return <Comment key={i} author={comment.author}>{comment.text}<\/Comment>;\n       });\n       return (\n         <ReactTransitionGroup transitionName=\"comment\">\n           {commentNodes}\n         <\/ReactTransitionGroup>\n       );\n     }\n   });\n   ```\n\n * with [node-sass](https:\/\/github.com\/andrew\/node-sass) and without the need for installing any ruby dependencies your project can stay in plain javascript. So no extra installations needed. Also node-sass seems to process scss files much faster then ruby sass. The downside of node-sass that not all mixins or mixin libries are compatible. Especially [compass](http:\/\/compass-style.org\/) doesn't work with it.\n\n * [Bourbon](http:\/\/bourbon.io\/) is a neat little mixin library for sass that is compatible with node-sass. It has all the features I need. In my view the documentation is better than compass' and with [Bourbon Neat](http:\/\/neat.bourbon.io\/) it also has a nice grid framework. Because Bourbon is plain scss there are no compatibility issues between versions like I had to experience with ruby sass and compass.\n\n * I chose to just play with React's [Tutorial](http:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react\/docs\/tutorial.html) implementation of a comment box. The use of components makes the code really readable and with JSX there is a easy to understand syntax for templating. You don't need to use JSX but it makes the source code of the components even more understandable. For example the comment form looks like this:\n\n   ```\n   \/** @jsx React.DOM *\/\n   'use strict';\n\n   var React = require('react');\n\n   module.exports = React.createClass({\n     handleSubmit: function() {\n       var author = this.refs.author.getDOMNode().value.trim();\n       var text = this.refs.text.getDOMNode().value.trim();\n       this.props.onCommentSubmit({author: author, text: text});\n       this.refs.author.getDOMNode().value = '';\n       this.refs.text.getDOMNode().value = '';\n       return false;\n     },\n     render: function() {\n       return (\n         <div className=\"commentForm\">\n           <form className=\"commentForm\" onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\n             <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Your name\" ref=\"author\" \/>\n             <textarea placeholder=\"Say something...\" ref=\"text\"><\/textarea>\n             <button type=\"submit\">Post<\/button>\n           <\/form>\n         <\/div>\n       );\n     }\n   });\n   ```\n\n* Because I wanted to use Websockets instead of ajax with the react tutorial and all the new information I got about streams by using gulp, I decided to use [shoe](https:\/\/github.com\/substack\/shoe). The browser implementation is straight forward. Open a stream to the server an then wait for data to come. If you want to send data to the server, just write to the stream.\n\n   ```\n   var stream = shoe('\/comments');\n   this.stream.on('data', function (data) {\n     this.setState({data: JSON.parse(data)});\n   });\n   this.stream.write(JSON.stringify(comment));\n   ```\n   If you want to know more about the server side have a look [here](https:\/\/github.com\/aslansky\/react-stack-playground\/blob\/master\/server\/index.js). The [shoe documentation](https:\/\/github.com\/substack\/shoe) also has some nice examples.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFirst of all, it is fun to play with new things. You should try it sometimes. Second, the experience was great. All the libraries and tools work nice together and I can imagine building a web application with this stack. The next thing I want to look into, is how to combine [director](https:\/\/github.com\/flatiron\/director) with React to have a router for a single page site.\n","46":"Shoes Tutorial Note\n===================\n**- For the Shoes App Rookie Creators -**\n\nJuly 10th, 2010 by ashbb\n\nTable of contents\n-----------------\n1.

Our primary focus is to continue improving the app for our users in line with our roadmap.\n\nThe best way to submit feedback and report bugs is to open a Github issue. Please be sure to include your operating system, device, version number, and steps to reproduce reported bugs. Keep in mind that all participants will be expected to follow our code of conduct.\n\n***\n\nCode of Conduct\n==============\nWe aim to share our knowledge and findings to the professor as we work daily to improve our product, for Examnition community, in a safe and open space. We work as we live, as kind and considerate students who learn and grow from giving and receiving positive, constructive feedback. professor reserve the right to delete or edit any of his students.\n\n\ncolor palette\n==========\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mohamedebrahim96\/Quiz-App\/raw\/master\/files\/files2\/1fffff.jpg\" width=\"350\">\n\n\n\n\n## Supported Devices\n```sh\n* android Kitkat 4.4.2 (API-19)\n* android Lollipop 5.0\/5.1(API-21)\n* android Marshmallow (API-23)\n* android nougat 7.0 (API-24)\n* android tablets \n```\n\n\n\n## Third-party\n```sh\n* Room Persistence Library V1.1.0\n* espresso-core:3.0.1 (https:\/\/github.com\/chiuki\/espresso-samples)\n* picasso 2.3.2 (https:\/\/github.com\/square\/picasso)\n* Calligraphy 2.3.0 (https:\/\/github.com\/chrisjenx\/Calligraphy)\n* SwitchButton 2.0.0 (https:\/\/github.com\/kyleduo\/SwitchButton)\n* Slider 1.1.5 (https:\/\/github.com\/daimajia\/AndroidImageSlider)\n* Retrofit 2.4.0 (https:\/\/github.com\/square\/retrofit)\n* Glide 4.2.0 (https:\/\/github.com\/bumptech\/glide)\n* Jsoup 1.10.3 (https:\/\/github.com\/jhy\/jsoup)\n```\n\n\n## Release History\n\n* 0.2.1\n   * updating Exam layers and layouts.\n   * make some improvements and enhancement.\n   * upload results on the server.\n   * make the android app repo on Github.com\n* 0.2.0\n    * add a local Database (Room).\n* 0.1.1\n    * Fix some bugs.\n    * new Activitys new layouts.\n* 0.1.0\n    * add advanced settings of the user to add ip etc..\n    * add login&signup layouts\/fragmnts.\n* 0.0.1\n    * Add exam timers and points.\n\n\n\n## Updates log\n\n* april 29, 2018\n   -updating Exam layers and layouts.\n   -make some improvements and enhancement.\n   -upload results on the server.\n   -make the android app repo on Github.com\n* mar 9, 2018\n     -add a local Database (Room).\n     -store the results and view them\n* Sep 26, 2017\n     -Fix some bugs.\n     -new Activitys new layouts.\n* Aug 29, 2017\n     -add advanced settings of the user to add ip etc..\n     -add login&signup layouts\/fragmnts.\n* Apr 4, 2014\n      -Add exam timers and points.\n\n\n\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n    Copyright 2018 Vacuum, Inc.\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n    \n    \n<!-- Markdown link & img dfn's -->\n[npm-image]: https:\/\/img.shields.io\/npm\/v\/datadog-metrics.svg?style=flat-square\n[npm-url]: https:\/\/npmjs.org\/package\/datadog-metrics\n[npm-downloads]: https:\/\/img.shields.io\/npm\/dm\/datadog-metrics.svg?style=flat-square\n[travis-image]: https:\/\/img.shields.io\/travis\/dbader\/node-datadog-metrics\/master.svg?style=flat-square\n[travis-url]: https:\/\/travis-ci.org\/dbader\/node-datadog-metrics\n[wiki]: https:\/\/github.com\/yourname\/yourproject\/wiki\n\n","51":"","52":"# ShoesShop-Flutter\n\nInstallation\n\n```\nflutter pub get\n```\nUsage \n\n```\nflutter run\n```\n![Screenshot (163)](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/52289151\/154484470-d994f731-8662-4960-8763-e102a114e68c.png)\n","53":"# Unity-Barracuda-Objectron-WebGL\nUnity Barracuda\u3067[MediaPipe Objectron(Shoe)](https:\/\/google.github.io\/mediapipe\/solutions\/objectron)\u3092\u52d5\u4f5c\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>\n\u307e\u305f\u3001\u73fe\u6642\u70b9(2021\/06\/03)\u3067Unity\u306eWebGL\u306fCPU\u63a8\u8ad6\u306e\u307f\u306e\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u3002<br><br>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/37477845\/120523202-9a2b9380-c410-11eb-9589-bc30892fae3f.gif\" width=\"60%\"><br>\n\u203b\u4e0a\u8a18\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u306f\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u4e0a\u3067\u306eWebGL\u5b9f\u884c(CPU\u63a8\u8ad6)\n\n# Demo\n\u52d5\u4f5c\u78ba\u8a8d\u7528\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u306f\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3002<br>\n[https:\/\/kazuhito00.github.io\/Unity-Barracuda-Objectron-WebGL\/WebGL-Build](https:\/\/kazuhito00.github.io\/Unity-Barracuda-Objectron-WebGL\/WebGL-Build\/)\n\n# Requirement (Unity)\n* Unity 2021.1.0b6 or later\n* Barracuda 1.3.0 or later\n\n# FPS(\u53c2\u8003\u5024)\nWebCamController.cs \u306e Update()\u306e\u547c\u3073\u51fa\u3057\u5468\u671f\u3092\u8a08\u6e2c\u3057\u305f\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>\n\u63a8\u8ad6\u306b\u975e\u540c\u671f\u51e6\u7406\u306e\u305f\u3081\u3001FPS\u306f\u898b\u304b\u3051\u4e0a\u306eFPS\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u63a8\u8ad6\u81ea\u4f53\u306eFPS\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002<br>\n|  | Objectron(Shoe) |\n| -

This usually defaults to the number of CPUs.\n\n    -d, --dry-run\n        Parse the config and exit.\n```\n\n## Config format\n\nSorry, formal documentation for the YAML config format have not yet been written. You can refer to the [examples](.\/examples), or open an issue if you need help.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- Proxy client chaining\n- SOCKS and Shadowsocks UDP support\n","55":"HELLO!\n======\n\nThis is a copy of the original web site written by [_why](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Why_the_lucky_stiff).\n\nIt's now gone. :(\n\n![000.jpg](https:\/\/github.com\/spiralofhope\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/000.jpg)\n\nIn case you've just arrived: Shoes is a graphics toolkit for writing colorful apps using [the Ruby programming language](http:\/\/www.ruby-lang.org\/en\/).  Ruby is built into Shoes.\n\nShoes wants to fit in.  It will change the way it looks for each person's computer.  These screenshots were taken on my computer, but when you run them for yourself they will look just like your other programs.  Try it!\n\nTHE TUTORIAL WALKTHROUGH\n========================\n\nAn introduction to Shoes. Code and graphical pairs.\n\nOkay, so, a simple Shoes program.\n\n![001.png](https:\/\/github.com\/ashbb\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/001.png)\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app { button \"Push me\" }\n```\n\nYou can just save the program in a file called little.rb and open it with Shoes.\n\nThe braces `{` and `}` are a kind of container. The button is \"in\" the app.\n\n----------------------\n\n![002.png](https:\/\/github.com\/spiralofhope\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/002.png)\n\nWe can place a few buttons in a *stack*.\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app {\n  stack {\n    button \"A bed of clams\"\n    button \"A coalition of cheetahs\"\n    button \"A gulp of swallows\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nStacks are essential! The most important two elements in Shoes are *stacks* and *flows*.\n\n----------------------\n\n\n![003.png](https:\/\/github.com\/spiralofhope\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/003.png)\n\nOkay, let's give the stack a bit of a *margin*. Scoot it out from the edge.\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app {\n  background white\n  stack(:margin => 8) {\n    button \"A bed of clams\"\n    button \"A coalition of cheetahs\"\n    button \"A gulp of swallows\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe also painted the *background* white. Did you see that?\n\n<!--\nTODO:  Make the margin 50.  It has to be noticeable.\nTODO:  Change the background to another more noticeable colour.  Re-screenshot.\n-->\n\n----------------------\n\n![004.png](https:\/\/github.com\/spiralofhope\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/004.png)\n\nTime for something new, artwork!  Let's draw!\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app {\n  oval(\n    :left => 10,\n    :top => 10,\n    :radius => 40\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe Shoes brush always starts out black.\n\nNotice that while buttons just dropped into the window, we drew the circle at a specific place. At 10 pixels from the left edge of the window and 10 pixels below the top edge.\n\n----------------------\n\n![005.png](https:\/\/github.com\/spiralofhope\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/005.png)\n\nNow, a rectangle and an arrow.\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app {\n  fill red\n  rect(\n    :left => 10,\n    :top => 10,\n    :width => 40\n  )\n  arrow(\n    :left => 30,\n    :top => 60,\n    :width => 40\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe *fill* is red on these shapes. And the *stroke* is black. (Because we didn't change it.) These two pens - stroke and fill - draw every shape.\n\nDid you see how the arrow is a little overtop of the rectangle?\n\n<!--\nTODO:  Change the colour of the two shapes.  Then update the screenshot.\n-->\n\n----------------------\n\nOf course, you can always design your app with an *image*. Even images from the web!\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app {\n  image \"http:\/\/spiralofhope.com\/i\/ruby-shoes--nks-kidnap.png\"\n}\n```\n<!--\nAs of 2011-08-27, GitHub does not allow hotlinking.  If a Shoes program tries to use an image that is stored on a GitHub server, nothing will display.  This is why this example image must be hosted elsewhere.  The image will still be placed in the github repository and referred-to locally, so we don't ever lose it.\n\nThe remotely-hosted image was also edited to remove the toolbar.  It's been archived locally (nks-kidnap--modified.png) so it doesn't get lost.\n-->\n\n![Aaaa.  My sweet children, I have kidnapped you!  And brought you to my secret Shoes study class!!](https:\/\/github.com\/spiralofhope\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/nks-kidnap.png)\n\nShoes even caches images in memory and on disk, like browsers do. Images are loaded in background threads as well, to prevent apps from slowing down.\n\n----------------------\n\nNow, a very important element: the *para*. As in: paragraph. Probably the third most important element (after stacks and flows.)\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app {\n  para strong(\"Q.\"), \" Are you beginning to grasp hold of Shoes?\"\n}\n```\n\n![007.png](https:\/\/github.com\/spiralofhope\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/007.png)\n\n----------------------\n\nBeyond para, you've got *title* and *subtitle*, which are bigger fonts. You can add a bunch of font styles as well. Look for *strong* and *em* in this bit.\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app {\n  stack(:margin => 6) {\n    title \"A Question\"\n    para strong(\"Q.\"), \" Are you beginning to grasp hold of Shoes?\"\n    para em(strong(\"A.\"), \" Quit pestering me, I'm hacking here.\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\n![008.png](https:\/\/github.com\/spiralofhope\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/008.png)\n\n----------------------\n\n![009.png](https:\/\/github.com\/spiralofhope\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/009.png)\n\nKeep track of stuff by naming them as variables.\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app {\n  @push = button \"Push me\"\n  @note = para \"Nothing pushed so far\"\n}\n```\n\n----------------------\n\n![010.png](https:\/\/github.com\/spiralofhope\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/010.png)\n\nYou can then put the variables into action. When the button is clicked, the `@note` changes to the message shown in the picture.\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app {\n  @push = button \"Push me\"\n  @note = para \"Nothing pushed so far\"\n  @push.click {\n    @note.replace \"Aha! Click!\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n----------------------\n\n![011.png](https:\/\/github.com\/spiralofhope\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/011.png)\n\nSee if you can figure out this one. How does the gradient work? How are the letters styled?\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app do\n  background \"#F3F\"..\"#F90\"\n  title(\n    \"Shoooes\",\n    :top => 60,\n    :align => \"center\",\n    :font => \"Trebuchet MS\",\n    :stroke => white\n  )\nend\n```\n\nIn this example, I used *do* and end *rather* than the braces `{` and `}`. They have the same meaning.\n\n----------------------\n\n![012.png](https:\/\/github.com\/spiralofhope\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/012.png)\n\nAha, here's a flow. It keeps the text box and the button side-by-side.\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app do\n  background \"#EFC\"\n  border(\n    \"#BE8\",\n    :strokewidth => 6\n  )\n  stack(:margin => 12) do\n    para \"Enter your name\"\n    flow do\n      edit_line\n      button \"OK\"\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n----------------------\n\n![013.png](https:\/\/github.com\/spiralofhope\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/013.png)\n\nIn this one, we make a five-point star. And it follows the mouse around as you move.\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app do\n  @shape = star(:points => 5)\n  motion do |left, top|\n    @shape.move left, top\n  end\nend\n```\n\n----------------------\n\nOn to a taste of animation. The Shoes icon moves randomly a bunch of times each second.\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app do\n  @shoes = image(\n    \"http:\/\/spiralofhope.com\/i\/ruby-shoes--shoes.png\",\n    :top => 100,\n    :left => 100\n  )\n  animate do |i|\n    @shoes.top += (-20..20).rand\n    @shoes.left += (-20..20).rand\n  end\nend\n```\n\n![014.png](https:\/\/github.com\/spiralofhope\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/014.png)\n\n----------------------\n\n![015.png](https:\/\/github.com\/spiralofhope\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/015.png)\n<!--\nTODO:  Update this screenshot to remove the blank line at the top.\n-->\n\nRemember a few examples ago when we handled a button click? How about doing the same with a link?\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app do\n  @poem = stack do\n    para \"My eyes have blinked again\nAnd I have just realized\nThis upright world \nI have been in.\n\nMy eyelids wipe\nMy eyes hundreds of times\nReseting and renovating\nThe scenery.\"\n  end\n  para(\n    link(\"Clear\").click do\n      @poem.clear\n    end\n  )\nend\n```\n\nSo, when the link gets clicked, the stack gets cleared. The poem will disappear.\n\n----------------------\n\n![016.png](https:\/\/github.com\/spiralofhope\/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough\/raw\/master\/imgs\/016.png)\n\nOkay, last one for now. Let's generate a hundred random circles. This example also uses the *rgb* method to make colors from red, green and blue fractions.\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app(:width => 300, :height => 400) do\n  fill rgb(0, 0.6, 0.9, 0.1)\n  stroke rgb(0, 0.6, 0.9)\n  strokewidth 0.25\n  100.times do\n    oval(\n      :left => (-5..self.width).rand,\n      :top => (-5..self.height).rand,\n      :radius => (25..50).rand\n    )\n  end\nend\n```\n\nDon't worry if you haven't picked up a whole lot reading through these.

It uses XML HTTP commands, like those in the HEOS App, and it is designed to replace and possibly extend the functionality of the app.  SHOE has been developed and tested on HEOS1 HS2 speakers, running version 1.520.200 firmware.\n\nThe SHOE package is split into two components:\n1. A library call **shoelib** that enables access to HEOS speakers via other Python programs. This\n   provides the low level communication interface.\n2. A CLI client program called **shoe** that provides a front end to drive **shoelib**\n   functionality.\n\nCurrently, **shoe** has no special commands to use the speakers as renderers or control the speakers as streaming devices.  However, it does expose the renderer device command.  This functionality can be achieved using a variety of uPNP software packages.\n\nNote that SHOE is *not* based on the HEOS CLI interface published by Denon.  That interface has limited functionality with regards to configuration.  For instance, the CLI spec doesn't address the creations of \"Zones\" and does not display Groups generated by the app.  The CLI may be useful for implementing playback functions, if SHOE ever goes that way, but the XML HTTP appears to expose a far more feature rich set.\n\n## Licensing and Stuff ##\nSHOE provided free, \"as is\", without warranty, under the GPL3 License.

SHOE requires a root XML, served from the HEOS device, to configure itself.  The URL can be found in the payload header of SSDP packets, gathered using a packet sniffing tool such as wireshark:\n\n    LOCATION: http:\/\/<Speaker IP>:<Port>\/upnp\/desc\/aios_device\/aios_device.xml\n\nThis is the location of the root XML file for the HEOS 1 speaker, version 1.520.200.  Other devices may have a different location.  The `shoe` program allows one to specify URL or a file on the command line.\n\n## Security considerations ##\nJust like the HEOS app, all communication between SHOE and Denon HEOS speakers is plaintext, without password protection.  From a practical perspective, any sensitive information stored on you speakers, including your WIFI password, may be be gathered through trivial methods.  Anyone with network access to your speaker, either via WIFI, or physical access to the Ethernet port, can access and control you speakers with SHOE.  Consider this when setting up your speakers on your network.\n\n# Version Release Notes #\n\n## v(0.1.5) ##\n\nThe goal is to remove configuration dependence from the HEOS app. SHOE will provide a minimal CLI interface that address devices via IP and allow for configuration of speakers without the use of the HEOS app.  With the limited feature set, the test focus will primarily be on ACT, GroupConfig, and ZoneConfig services.\n\nThe following features are implemented:\n1. Display information from the HEOS device.\n2. Provide CLI interface to execute individual commands on the HEOS device in an \"Expert Mode'\n3. Script more complex actions for easy configuration:\n- Naming a device\n- Binding devices into a \"Zone\" for multichannel speaker operation\n- Selecting channels.\n\n## v(0.1.7) ##\n- Fixed some issues with alternate xml url (-x option).\n- Added versioning option.\n- Better response if no host is given.\n- Fixed bug with shoeBond.\n\n## v(0.1.9) ##\n- Set python minimum version for PIP install to >=3.6\n- Added extended commands to README.md\n- Typo fixes to README.md\n\n# Future Possibilities #\n\nPossible future features:\n- Discovery\n- Network configuration\n- Bluetooth configuration\n- LED intensity\n- Rendering w\/ streaming services\n","62":"","63":"# NIKE_vs_ADIDAS\nImage Recognition classifier between nike and adidas basketball shoes.

With this feature, your users will be able to see in real time how the selected product looks on them, just by pointing their smartphone camera at their feet or wrist.\n\nThis tutorial walks you through the simplest try-on use case: load the library, start the camera, show the virtual try-on and unload everything when done. We won't be paying much attention to error handling or more elaborate use scenarios.\n\nCheck out also the code sample that implements this use case. See the **ios\/Swift** folder in the distribution.\n\n<!-- TOC -->\n\n- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n\t- [Cocoapods](#cocoapods)\n\t- [Frameworks](#frameworks)\n- [Step-by-step](#step-by-step)\n\t- [Write your part of the code](#write-your-part-of-the-code)\n\t- [Implement virtual try-on](#implement-virtual-try-on)\n- [Sample](#sample)\n- [Distribution](#distribution)\n- [System requirements](#system-requirements)\n\n<!-- \/TOC -->\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo work with WANNA SDK, you will need:\n\n* **WANNA distribution**. <br>\nUse either the frameworks or the cocoapods.\n* the **license key** that authorizes WANNA SDK use. <br>\nContact our sales representative at [account@wanna.fashion](mailto:account@wanna.fashion) to get one.\n* **3D models** of your products. <br>\nA model ID should be an alphanumeric string, with hyphens and underscores but no other special characters. Otherwise, set the IDs in any way convenient to you: the ID can be an internal product code or a vendor ID, as long as it is unique for each model. The models will be stored in a content delivery network (CDN) to ensure availability across different regions. Note that each color should have its own model\u2014WANNA SDK can't touch up the colors on the fly.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd WANNA SDK to your project either as a cocoapods or by embedding the frameworks in your Xcode project.\n\n### Cocoapods\n\nCreate a Podfile if you haven't yet:\n\n```\n$ cd <your-project-directory>\n$ pod init\n```\n\nAdd `pod WannaSDK` to your Podfile:\n\n```\nsource 'https:\/\/github.com\/CocoaPods\/Specs.git'\n\nplatform :ios, '13.0'\n\ninhibit_all_warnings!\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\n  pod 'WannaSDK', '6.0.0'\nend\n```\n\nInstall the pod:\n\n```\n$ pod install\n```\n\nOpen **Example.xcworkspace** file in Xcode.\n\n**NOTE:** when you open Example.**xcodeproj** instead of Example.**xcworkspace** it will result in compiller error **No such module \u2018WsneakersUISDK\u2019**\n\n\n\n### Frameworks\n\n1. Add **WsneakersCoreSDK.xcframework** and **WsneakersUISDK.xcframework** to your project in Xcode.\n2. Embed these frameworks in the main bundle of your project.\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n### Write your part of the code\n\nWANNA SDK will only provide the try-on experience. Some things you will have to implement for yourself:\n\n* the launch button on the product page\n* any overlays for the camera window, tips for the user, etc.\n\n### Implement virtual try-on\n\n**Note:** Add the `NSCameraUsageDescription` key to **Info.plist**, so that your app can use the camera.\n\nIn ViewController, add a new **UIView** component using Interface Builder and select `WsneakersUISDKView` custom class for it.\n\nWrite the code for working with the SDK in **WsneakersViewController.swift**:\n\n1. Initialize the try-on session.<br>\n**Important!** As a part of 6.0.0 fixes it was forbidden to create parallel sessions. Starting from 6.0.0 you will receive an error if the new session is created before previous one was deallocated. \n    To simplify integration `+(BOOL)waitForSessionDestroyWithTimeout` method was introduced to our\n    SDK. It runs synchronously from the calling queue and waits until previous session is\n    deallocated. After this method returns `true` you can safely create a new session.<br>\nFor sneakers, call the `createSession` method:<br>\n`let session = try WsneakersUISDKSession.createSession(withConfig: clientConfig, withBorderCrop: 0.0, progress: { progress in\n                return true\n            })`<br>\nFor watches, call the `createWatch` method:<br>\n`let session = try WsneakersUISDKSession.createWatch(withConfig: clientConfig, withBorderCrop: 0.0, progress: { progress in\n                return true\n            })`<br>\nNote that this method requires the license key (`clientConfig`) that authorizes your use of WANNA SDK.<br>\nIf needed, crop the try-on view with a different value of `borderCrop`, so that the relevant area is zoomed in. You may want to show a progress indicator in the progress block, because the initialization, with loading all the resources, will take some time.<br>\nThe good time to initialize is when the user goes to a screen that offers virtual try-on and you expect them to use it. Note that initialization will take up some processing resources and download traffic on the user's device. To prevent overuse of these resources, avoid initializing too early.<br>\n2. Implement a `WsneakersUISDKSessionDelegate` protocol and assign it to the `delegate` property of the session object. The `hasVisibleFeet` parameter will tell you if we've found the object on which to try on your product - feet or wrist - in the camera view. This can be useful if you'd like to show a tip to the user when the camera isn't pointed in the right direction.\n3. Connect the view you created to the session via an outlet:<br>\n`@IBOutlet var tryonView : WsneakersUISDKView!\nwsneakersSession.wsneakersUISDKView = wsneakersView`\n4. When the session has loaded and everything is ready, `startSession` to begin work.\n5. To show the try-on screen, call the `startDrawing` method each time the try-on becomes active.\n6. Make sure your app handles the \"idle\" time with no user input so that the screen isn't dimmed or turned off during virtual try-on:<br>\n`UIApplication.shared.isIdleTimerDisabled = true`<br>\nDon't forget to reset this setting when the try-on session is completed. See the recommendations at https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/uikit\/uiapplication\/1623070-isidletimerdisabled\n7. Once the session has loaded successfully, create the storage object that will load and manage models. Use the `createStorage` method, passing in the client configuration string. This is also where you can limit cache size for model storage, we suggest about 200 MB.<br>\n`let storage = try! WsneakersUISDKRenderModelStorage.createStorage(withConfig: clientConfig, withCacheSize: 1024*1024*200)`<br>\nOnce the user has tried on a model, it will be kept in cache until you destroy the session. If the stored models overflow the cache, WANNA SDK will delete the model that was unused the longest. If you need to remove the stored models, call `clearCache`.<br>\n**Important!** You may not create a storage instance in different threads simultaneously.\n8. Call the `getRenderModel` method of the storage object, passing the model ID as input. At this point we will download the model, which may take some time. If the user has tried this model on in this session and it's already in cache, that will save time.<br>\nThe completion block will contain a `WsneakersUISDKRenderModel` object representing the model.\n9. Pass the model object into the `changeRenderModel` method of the session object. WANNA SDK will render the product on the user's feet, or wrist, once they are in the frame.\n10. Whenever the user goes out of the virtual try-on, `stopDrawing` to turn off the camera view and the model rendering. If they then come back, `startDrawing` again. You might also want to `removeRenderModel` from the session, so that the old model won't be showing while the new one isn't ready yet.\n11. When the user is done with their session, `stopDrawing` and `stopSession` to clear the resources. Note that the 3D models storage is kept even after exiting the app, and the stored models will be available on the next run.\n\n## Sample\n\nOur distribution includes a simple code sample in Swift: see **ios\/Swift** folder in the distribution.

Not sure if this was intended, but it turns out that Microsoft was kind enough to package the Analysis Services engine (msmdsrv.exe) with their Power BI Desktop tool which is available free of charge. This essentially gives you everything you need to set up an Analysis Services server - and yes, that includes the tabular model.\n\nIn order to get started, do the following:\n- Install Power BI Desktop (here I'm assuming you're using the 64-bit version).\n- Create the msmdsrv.ini file containing the server properties. You can read about the various options [on MS website](http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/ms174556.aspx). Most importantly, make sure you know the PID (process ID) of the application that will call the Analysis Services engine (i.e. the PrivateProcess property). I wasn't able to get it to work without this. For me, this meant finding the PID of the Command Prompt. Also, set the DeploymentMode setting (multidimensional, tabular, Power Pivot for SharePoint) and pick the port that works for you.\n- Start the msmdsrv.exe engine by pointing it at the folder where you put the .ini file:\n```\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Power BI Desktop\\bin\\msmdsrv.exe\" -c -s [YOUR FOLDER (in quotes if path contains spaces)]\n```\n- Your Analysis Services server is now running at \"localhost:port\" and can be queried using any of the clients that can talk to an AS server. For example, you can connect to the engine using the (free) SQL Server Management Studio. Note that your choice of the DeploymentMode property determines what you can do with your instance.\n- Alternatively, you can simply start the Power BI Desktop (which in turn starts the msmdsrv.exe engine) and determine the randomly-assigned port that the AS engine is using. Then connect to the instance using \"localhost:port\" as above. However, note that in this case you will not be able to set the location of your instance and its type; it'll be located in a random subfolder in \n```\nC:\\Users\\[USER]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Power BI Desktop\\AnalysisServicesWorkspaces\n```\nfolder and it will always be of the Power Pivot for SharePoint type (i.e. DeploymentMode=1).\n\nHere's an example of the msmdsrv.ini file used to initiatize the AS engine in the tabular mode:\n```\n<ConfigurationSettings>\n   <DataDir>[YOUR FOLDER]<\/DataDir>\n   <TempDir>[YOUR FOLDER]<\/TempDir>\n   <LogDir>[YOUR FOLDER]<\/LogDir>\n   <BackupDir>[YOUR FOLDER]<\/BackupDir>\n   <DeploymentMode>2<\/DeploymentMode>\n   <RecoveryModel>1<\/RecoveryModel>\n   <DisklessModeRequested>0<\/DisklessModeRequested>\n   <CleanDataFolderOnStartup>1<\/CleanDataFolderOnStartup>\n   <AutoSetDefaultInitialCatalog>1<\/AutoSetDefaultInitialCatalog>\n   <Network>\n      <Requests>\n         <EnableBinaryXML>1<\/EnableBinaryXML>\n         <EnableCompression>1<\/EnableCompression>\n      <\/Requests>\n      <Responses>\n         <EnableBinaryXML>1<\/EnableBinaryXML>\n         <EnableCompression>1<\/EnableCompression>\n         <CompressionLevel>9<\/CompressionLevel>\n      <\/Responses>\n      <ListenOnlyOnLocalConnections>1<\/ListenOnlyOnLocalConnections>\n   <\/Network>\n   <Port>[YOUR PORT]<\/Port>\n   <PrivateProcess>[PID]<\/PrivateProcess>\n   <InstanceVisible>0<\/InstanceVisible>\n   <Language>1033<\/Language>\n   <Debug>\n      <CallStackInError>0<\/CallStackInError>\n   <\/Debug>\n   <Log>\n      <Exception>\n         <CrashReportsFolder>[YOUR FOLDER]<\/CrashReportsFolder>\n      <\/Exception>\n      <FlightRecorder>\n         <Enabled>0<\/Enabled>\n      <\/FlightRecorder>\n   <\/Log>\n   <AllowedBrowsingFolders>[YOUR FOLDER]<\/AllowedBrowsingFolders>\n   <ResourceGovernance>\n      <GovernIMBIScheduler>0<\/GovernIMBIScheduler>\n   <\/ResourceGovernance>\n   <Feature>\n      <ManagedCodeEnabled>1<\/ManagedCodeEnabled>\n   <\/Feature>\n   <VertiPaq>\n      <EnableDisklessTMImageSave>0<\/EnableDisklessTMImageSave>\n      <EnableProcessingSimplifiedLocks>1<\/EnableProcessingSimplifiedLocks>\n   <\/VertiPaq>\n<\/ConfigurationSettings>\n```\n\n## Next steps - querying the Power Pivot model using Python 2.7\n\nWhat now? Well, there's all sorts of things you can do. Below is a snippet showing you how to take a Power Pivot model (which is nothing else but an ABF database backup that's packaged inside of an Excel file) and use AMO.NET assembly to restore the model into our new AS instance, then query it using ADOMD.NET. [I'm using the [Excel 2013 version of the sample Power Pivot file](http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/download\/details.aspx?id=102).]\n\nNote that this is a POC-type-of code; it just illustrates the approach and doesn't purport to be optimized in any way. The entire code has also been posted on [StackOverflow](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/a\/36878268\/5803031).\n\nStep 1: Load all modules and .NET assemblies used by the code.\n```\nimport psutil, subprocess, random, os, zipfile, shutil, clr, sys, pandas\n\ndef initialSetup(pathPowerBI):\n    sys.path.append(pathPowerBI)\n\n    #required Analysis Services assemblies\n    clr.AddReference(\"Microsoft.PowerBI.Amo.Core\")\n    clr.AddReference(\"Microsoft.PowerBI.Amo\")     \n    clr.AddReference(\"Microsoft.PowerBI.AdomdClient\")\n    \n    global AMO, ADOMD\n    import Microsoft.AnalysisServices as AMO\n    import Microsoft.AnalysisServices.AdomdClient as ADOMD\n```\n\nStep 2: Create a random folder, extract the item.data (or item1.data if dealing with the Excel 2010 version) file from the .xlsx file, append .abf to its name, then start the Command Prompt and determine what PID it was assigned by Windows. Then create the msmdsrv.ini settings file and save it in the random folder created. Finally, start the AS engine, connect to it using AMO.NET and finally restore the backup into it.\n```\ndef restorePowerPivot(excelName, pathTarget, port, pathPowerBI):   \n    #create random folder\n    os.chdir(pathTarget)\n    folder = os.getcwd()+str(random.randrange(10**6,10**7))\n    os.mkdir(folder)\n    \n    #extract PowerPivot model (abf backup)\n    archive=zipfile.ZipFile(excelName)\n    for member in archive.namelist():\n        if \".data\" in member:\n            filename = os.path.basename(member)\n            abfname = os.path.join(folder, filename)+\".abf\"\n            source = archive.open(member)\n            target = file(os.path.join(folder, abfname), 'wb')\n            shutil.copyfileobj(source, target)\n            del target\n    archive.close()\n    \n    #start the cmd.exe process to get its PID\n    listPIDpre = [proc for proc in psutil.process_iter()]\n    process = subprocess.Popen('cmd.exe \/k', stdin=subprocess.PIPE)\n    listPIDpost = [proc for proc in psutil.process_iter()]\n    pid = [proc for proc in listPIDpost if proc not in listPIDpre if \"cmd.exe\" in str(proc)][0]\n    pid = str(pid).split(\"=\")[1].split(\",\")[0]\n    \n    #msmdsrv.ini\n

ADOMDConn=ADOMD.AdomdConnection(\"Data Source=localhost:{0}\".format(port))\n    ADOMDConn.Open()\n    ADOMDCommand=ADOMDConn.CreateCommand() \n    ADOMDCommand.CommandText = query\n    \n    #read data in via AdomdDataReader object\n    DataReader = ADOMDCommand.ExecuteReader()\n    \n    #get metadata, number of columns\n    SchemaTable=DataReader.GetSchemaTable()\n    numCol = SchemaTable.Rows.Count #same as DataReader.FieldCount\n    \n    #get column names\n    columnNames = []\n    for i in range(numCol):\n        columnNames.append(str(SchemaTable.Rows[i][0]))\n    \n    #fill with data\n    data = []\n    while DataReader.Read()==True:\n        row=[]\n        for j in range(numCol):\n            try:\n                row.append(DataReader[j].ToString())\n            except:\n                row.append(DataReader[j])\n        data.append(row)\n    df = pandas.DataFrame(data)\n    df.columns = columnNames \n    \n    if flag==0:\n        DataReader.Close()\n        ADOMDConn.Close()\n\t\n        return df     \n    else:\t\n        #metadata table\n        metadataColumnNames = []\n        for j in range(SchemaTable.Columns.Count):\n            metadataColumnNames.append(SchemaTable.Columns[j].ToString())\n        metadata=[]\n        for i in range(numCol):\n            row=[]\n            for j in range(SchemaTable.Columns.Count):\n                try:\n                    row.append(SchemaTable.Rows[i][j].ToString())\n                except:\n                    row.append(SchemaTable.Rows[i][j])\n            metadata.append(row)\n        metadf = pandas.DataFrame(metadata)\n        metadf.columns = metadataColumnNames\n\t\t\n        DataReader.Close()\n        ADOMDConn.Close()\n\t\n        return df, metadf\n```\n\nStep 4: Terminate the session.\n```\ndef endSession(process):\n    #terminate cmd.exe\n    process.terminate()\n    print \"Session terminated.\"\n```\n\n### Example\n\nIf you download the sample Power Pivot file from Microsoft's website, you can test everything by appropriately modifying the following couple of lines of code:\n```\npathPowerBI=\"C:\/Program Files\/Microsoft Power BI Desktop\/bin\"\ninitialSetup(pathPowerBI)\nsession = restorePowerPivot(\"D:\/Downloads\/PowerPivotTutorialSample.xlsx\", \"D:\/\", 60000, pathPowerBI)\ndf = runQuery(\"EVALUATE dbo_DimProduct\",60000,0)\ndf, metadf = runQuery(\"EVALUATE dbo_DimProduct\",60000,1)\nendSession(session)\n```\n\n## Final thoughts\nIf you want to restore the ABF file into the Power Pivot for Sharepoint type of AS instance, you need to do the following:\n```\nclr.AddReference(\"System.IO\") # mscorlib.dll\nimport System.IO as SIO\nStream = SIO.FileStream(target, 3) # 3 = FileMode.Open\nAMOImageLoadInfo=AMO.ImageLoadInfo(\"SomeDatabaseName\",\"SomeDatabaseID\", Stream, 0) # 0 = ReadWrite mode\nAMOServer.ImageLoad(AMOImageLoadInfo)\nAMOServer.Refresh()\nStream.Close()\n```\n\nAnd if you want to execute some arbitrary XMLA code, you can do the following:\n```\nAMOServer.Execute(YourXMLAcodeString)\n```\n## Update: Adding Users\nIf you'd like to add another user, see this

The AR module is linked to snapchat making user of the AR shoe filters that Snapchat provides. \n\n### Foot Size Measurement \n\nThis module provides the user with the ability to measure his\/her foot through the app. The user is asked to place the foot on an A4 size paper with the bottom of the foot aligned with the bottom of the sheet and take a picture of the foot along with the paper. A Flask server is hosted online which is where the image captured is sent. The server processes the image and calculates the size which is sent to the app and is displayed to the user.\n\n## Tools & Libraries Used\n\n* [Flutter](https:\/\/flutter.dev\/) (version 2.8)\n* [Flask](https:\/\/flask.palletsprojects.com\/en\/2.1.x\/)\n* [Dio](https:\/\/github.com\/flutterchina\/dio)\n* [http](https:\/\/github.com\/dart-lang\/http)\n* [url_launcher](https:\/\/github.com\/flutter\/plugins\/tree\/main\/packages\/url_launcher\/url_launcher) (to launch snapchat AR filter)\n* [camera](https:\/\/github.com\/flutter\/plugins\/tree\/main\/packages\/camera\/camera) (To make use of mobile camera to capture image)\n* [Lens studio](https:\/\/lensstudio.snapchat.com\/)\n\n## To run server locally\nThe server has been hosted online and the app sends a request to the remote server. To run the server locally for testing purposes the following can be done.\n\ncd into the server directory\n\n```\ncd server\n```\n\nRun the Flask server\n\n```\nflask run\n```\nThis should start the server at localhost.\n\n## Screenshots\n<img src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/aadilkhalifa\/virtual-try-on\/blob\/main\/screenshots\/ss1.jpeg?raw=true\" width=\"256\"\/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/aadilkhalifa\/virtual-try-on\/blob\/main\/screenshots\/ss2.jpeg?raw=true\" width=\"256\"\/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/aadilkhalifa\/virtual-try-on\/blob\/main\/screenshots\/ss3.jpeg?raw=true\" width=\"256\"\/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/aadilkhalifa\/virtual-try-on\/blob\/main\/screenshots\/ss4.jpeg?raw=true\" width=\"256\"\/>\n\n## References\n- https:\/\/github.com\/wildoctopus\/FeetAndShoeMeasurement\n","72":"# Shoe-Shape-Classifier\nUsing the shape context algorithm to classify shoe shapes.\n\n## The problem\nLet's say that you work at a fashion aggregator and you receive hundreds of different shoes every week from different retailers. These retailers send you one identifier and a few images **per shoe-model**, with different points of view (front-view, side-view, sole, etc). Sometimes they send you a \"default\" identifier, indicating which of the images for a given shoe should be displayed, normally the side view. However, this is not always the case. \n\nYou want your website to look perfect, so ideally, you want to always show the same point of view for all shoe images. Therefore, the question is: How do we find the side view as shoe-images come through the feed? \n\n## The proposed solution\nHere I show a version of part of the solution that I implemented back in the days when I faced this problem. The solution here presented uses the [Shape Context](https:\/\/www2.eecs.berkeley.edu\/Research\/Projects\/CS\/vision\/shape\/sc_digits.html) algorithm to compute the shape descriptors and [MiniBatchKMeans](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.cluster.MiniBatchKMeans.html) to cluster the shapes. \n\nFor a series of reasons I cannot share the dataset here. There are a series of plots and diagrams that I hope are sufficient to illustrate the process. \n\nThe steps are:\n\n1-. Use the Shape Context Algorithm to parameterise the shape of the shoes\n\n2-. Use k-means (MiniBatch) to cluster the shapes\n\nYou will see that after clustering the shapes there is still some processing needed to isolate the side view. If I have the time I will upload an implementation of such processing. \n\n## Additional use and further improvements\n\nAs it is straightforward to understand, the shape arrays can also be used to build a content-based recommendation algorithm, recommending shoes of similar shape. One could complement this with color histograms or using additional features, such as [haralick textural features](http:\/\/haralick.org\/journals\/TexturalFeatures.pdf), or [GIST descriptors](http:\/\/www.quaero.org\/media\/files\/bibliographie\/inria_qpr6_douze_gist_evaluation.pdf). \n\nOf course, ultimately, if you have the budget to pay for someone to classify the shoe images, you can turn your problem into a supervised one and use *Deep Learning*. A series of convolutional layers will capture shapes, color, patterns, etc.\n\n## The code:\n\nI have run this example with 5000 shoe images (`jpg`) that are in my disk, in a directory: *data\/shoe_images\/*\n\nIn the \"real world\" the image feed normally comes in a form of json files with urls pointing towards the images.\n\nThe images are of 150 width and varying height (relative to the width). If you have a similar dataset, you could run the code by simply\n\nTO RUN:\n\n`python cluster_shoe_shapes.py --n_clusters k`\n\nWhere `k` is the number of clusters to use. \n\nPerhaps, the most usefull part of this repo is at the directory demo, where details of the process are provided. There I recommend to have a look to the notebooks in the following order: \n\n1) morphology_utilities.ipynb\n\n2) shape_context_algo.ipynb\n\n3) clustering_shapes.ipynb\n\n4) remove_background.ipynb\n\nI will emphasize again, I cannot share the dataset. But I am sure once you go through the notebooks you will easily be able to \"play\" with your own images. \n","73":"# UI-SHOES-STORE\r\n![UI-SHOES-STORE](img-01.jpg) ![UI-SHOES-STORE](img-02.jpg)\r\n\r\nA new Flutter project.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nThis project is a starting point for a Flutter application.\r\n\r\nA few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:\r\n\r\n- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https:\/\/flutter.io\/docs\/get-started\/codelab)\r\n- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https:\/\/flutter.io\/docs\/cookbook)\r\n\r\nFor help getting started with Flutter, view our \r\n[online documentation](https:\/\/flutter.io\/docs), which offers tutorials, \r\nsamples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.\r\n","74":"# boot\n\nAn automatic reconnect mux-demux-shoe\n\nThe mdm connection you get from shoe will magically handle reconnection\nlogic for you under the hood.

It feels like real Ruby, rather than just another C++ library wrapper. If Gtk or wxWidgets is Rails, Shoes is Sinatra.\n\n# Let me tell you a story about Shoes\n\n  Way way back in the day, there was a guy named \\_why. He created a project known as [Hackety Hack](http:\/\/hackety-hack.com) to teach programming to everyone. In order to reach all corners of the earth, \\_why decided to make Hackety Hack work on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. This was a lot of work, and so \\_why decided to share his toolkit with the world. Thus, Shoes was born.\n\nEverybody loved Shoes. Many apps were made, and put into [The Shoebox](http:\/\/the-shoebox.org\/). But, one day, \\_why left. In his memory, Team Shoes assembled, and carried on making Shoes. They released Shoes version 3 in the late summer of 2010, but all was not good in Shoe-ville. You see, Shoes was barely held together by little bits of string. Three different platforms was a lot of work! And since \\_why wasn't around to help, the code was confusing in places, and there were lots of little problems. Also, new versions of Windows and OSX came out after \\_why's mysterious disappearance, and it was hard to test them all.\n\nTherefore, Team Shoes decided upon a grand experiment. Shoes would become many different colored Shoes. And thus, Blue Shoes was born. Alongside it, there are also Green Shoes, built with GTK, and Brown Shoes, on JRuby. The original Shoes became Red Shoes.\n\nBut we're not here to talk about all those other Shoes... you care about Blue Shoes! It was started by the new champion of Hackety Hack, Steve Klabnik. Blue Shoes signifies the return of the union from which Shoes was originally born, and is made with Hackety Hack in mind. It's built on top of the QT library, which runs natively on all three platforms.\n\n# Helping out with Blue Shoes\n\nSo you're intrigued, eh? Great! Blue Shoes is currently in the very nanescent stages of development, so there's lots of stuff to help with! The first thing you'll need to do is set up an environment.\n\n## Setting up an environment\n\nFirst of all, you're going to need git. You can get it [here](http:\/\/git-scm.com\/).\n\nBlue Shoes works with Ruby 1.9.2. I'm using rvm, so to get 1.9.2, just `rvm install 1.9.2`, and wait!\n\nIf you don't have rvm, you can get it [here](http:\/\/rvm.beginrescueend.com\/). If you don't want to use rvm... you should.\n\n## Grab the source, luke\n\nFirst, make a fork here on GitHub! Just click the fork button.\n\nNext, clone your version:\n\n    $ git clone git@github.com:$YOUR_GITHUB_NAME\/blue_shoes.git\n\nThis'll make a `blue_shoes` directory, with all the code inside.\n\nThen, grab git-flow: http:\/\/github.com\/nvie\/gitflow\n\n`cd` into the `blue_shoes` directory, and type: '`git flow init`'. Give the default for all of the answers, except for when it asks you about `devel`. Use `development` instead.\n\n## Dependencies \n\nTo get qtbindings, first you need qt4 for your platform. Instructions shamelessly stolen from [here](http:\/\/github.com\/ryanmelt\/qtbindings):\n\nDebian Linux\n------------\n1. The following should get you the packages you need:\n\n    sudo apt-get install build-essential bison autoconf g++ zlib1g-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev libxslt-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev curl git-core subversion xorg-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev\n\n\nMac OSX Snow Leopard\n-----------------------\n1. XCode\n2. qt4-mac installed from macports - NOTE: For some reason smokegen does\n   not work with the SDK or Cocoa libraries directly from qt.nokia.com -\n   Uninstall these if necessary using:\n   sudo python \/Developer\/Tools\/uninstall_qt.py\n\nWindows - Note: Only necessary for debugging (binary gem available)\n--------\n1. mingw from the Qt SDK in your path: ie C:\\Qt\\2010.04\\mingw\\bin\n\n## Install the gem\n\nThen you just `gem install qtbindings`, and off you go!\n\n## Use Bundler\n\nBundler is gaining a lot of steam as a dependency management tool. So we're using it. To build your bundle, just type\n\n    $ bundle install\n\nand everything should get built.\n\n# What works\n\nRight now, very simple apps work. Check out the 'samples' directory for some examples.\n\n# Stubs\n\nAll methods and classes should be stubbed out. I went through the manual, and I think I got everything. Some classes have nothing in them, though, so I'm sure I'm missing some things! This was done in like 10 hours, with 6 of them being sleep...\n\n","81":"# Jest Module Name Mapper\n\n[![License](https:\/\/img.shields.io\/badge\/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/sebastianmusial\/jest-module-name-mapper\/master\/License)\n[![npm version](https:\/\/img.shields.io\/npm\/v\/jest-module-name-mapper.svg?style=flat)](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/jest-module-name-mapper)\n[![Build Status](https:\/\/travis-ci.com\/sebastianmusial\/jest-module-name-mapper.svg?branch=master)](https:\/\/travis-ci.com\/sebastianmusial\/jest-module-name-mapper)\n[![codecov](https:\/\/codecov.io\/gh\/sebastianmusial\/jest-module-name-mapper\/branch\/master\/graph\/badge.svg?token=Fsyuizk0Yl)](https:\/\/codecov.io\/gh\/sebastianmusial\/jest-module-name-mapper)\n\nUse this to avoid the declaration of the same module path aliases in `tsconfig.json` and `jest.config.js`. <br>\nThe package allows synchronizing Jest path aliases (`moduleNameMapper`) with your `tsconfig.json` configuration.\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm i jest-module-name-mapper -D`\n\n## Usage\n\nSet configuration in `jest.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  ...\n  moduleNameMapper: require('jest-module-name-mapper')(),\n};\n```\n\nIf your `tsconfig.json` file is located in other directory then root, then you can set your own path to the file.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  ...\n  moduleNameMapper: require('jest-module-name-mapper')('\/src\/tsconfig.json'),\n};\n```\n\n## Author\n\n<table border=\"0\">\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sebastianmusial\" style=\"color: white\">\n        <img src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sebastianmusial.png?s=150\" width=\"150\"\/>\n      <\/a>\n    <\/td>\n    <td>\n      <p><strong>Sebastian Musia\u0142<\/strong><\/p>\n      <p><img src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,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\" style=\"width: 18px;

This is due to the small amount of storage space available on the Raspberry Pi Pico (unable to store 500 GB blockchain). However, the Raspberry Pi full version can do all of this. So in a V2, the entire mining process should happen on device #1.\n\n## Credits\n\nCredits go to Satoshi Nakamoto and the entire Bitcoin community. \n","83":"\n\n<!--\n*** Thanks for checking out the Best-README-Template.

The layout flows like HTML. When _why first started writing Hackety Hack, he even tried to render Shoes apps using Firefox's Gecko engine. Unfortunately, that didn't work out. Now, a few years later, we have a convergence of 3 projects:\n\n* Opal: compiles Ruby into Javascript,\n* Atom-shell: renders HTML\/Javascript apps into a native window\n* Shoes 4: supports multiple backend implementations for Shoes apps\n\nThat's all we need to use a browser's rendering engine for Shoes apps. The difference this time is that, instead of generating C code from Ruby and trying to hook into the rendering engine primitives, we are generating Javascript and HTML code from Ruby and using the engine's normal DOM rendering, only in a custom application shell. Fun, right?\n\nHere's a \"Hello, world!\" example.\n\n```ruby\nShoes.app :width => 300, :height => 300 do\n  banner \"Hello, world!\"\nend\n```\n\n![shoes-atom](https:\/\/dl.dropboxusercontent.com\/spa\/0dcvxe71jtnccsf\/ccjx9fb2.png)\n![Shoes 4 (Swt)](https:\/\/dl.dropboxusercontent.com\/spa\/0dcvxe71jtnccsf\/3hyful8z.png)\n![Shoes 3](https:\/\/dl.dropboxusercontent.com\/spa\/0dcvxe71jtnccsf\/njr4w2da.png)\n\nAs an added bonus, if you just want to compile your Shoes app to a web page that any modern browser can render, you can do that, too! You lose a little functionality (for instance, you can't use the filesystem), but browsers are everywhere.\n\n![shoes-browser](https:\/\/dl.dropboxusercontent.com\/spa\/0dcvxe71jtnccsf\/s6ir4d2z.png)\n\n## Development status\n\nProof-of-concept. You can pretty much just write this \"Hello, world!\" app. Currently, this project tracks the HEAD version of Shoes 4, and includes minor monkeypatches to make things work nicely. Mostly, we are just ignoring the filesystem for now, but this shouldn't be a limitation in the future, except for the browser.\n\n\n## Getting started\n\n0. [Download atom-shell](https:\/\/github.com\/atom\/atom-shell\/releases) and install it. On OS X, unzip the download and drag it to `\/Applications`.\n\n1. Clone this repository.\n\n        $ git clone https:\/\/www.github.com\/wasnotrice\/shoes-atom.git\n        $ cd shoes-atom\n\n2. Create a local copy of Shoes 4. This step is necessary temporarily to work around [an issue with prerelease versions of gems](https:\/\/github.com\/rubygems\/rubygems\/issues\/988). _**Note:** Some changes have been made on Shoes 4 master that are (for the moment at least) incompatible with Opal. You should use shoes\/shoes4@6f2d017 for building `shoes-core`._\n\n        $ git clone https:\/\/www.github.com\/shoes\/shoes4.git\n        $ cd shoes4\n        $ git co 6f2d017\n        $ rake build:shoes-core\n        $ cd ..\/shoes-atom\/vendor\n        $ gem unpack ..\/shoes4\/shoes-core\/pkg\/shoes-core-4.0.0.pre3.gem\n        $ cd ..\n\n3. Install other dependencies.\n\n        $ bundle install\n\n4. Build the project. This compiles Opal, Shoes, and an example app.\n\n        $ rake\n\n    This compiles two versions of Shoes: `dist\/shoes-browser.js` and `dist\/shoes-atom.js`, for running in a browser, and in atom-shell, respectively. The example app in `examples\/hello.rb` gets compiled to `build\/hello\/browser` and `build\/hello\/atom`.\n\n5. Open the example app with your browser, or with your Atom app. On OS X, that looks like this:\n\n        $ open build\/hello\/browser\/index.html\n        $ \/Applications\/Atom.app\/Contents\/MacOS\/Atom build\/hello\/atom\n\nCongratulations. You're running a Shoes app :D\n\n\n## Tour of the project\n\nThe goal for this project is to provide two backends for Shoes apps: a `browser` backend and an `atom` backend. The browser backend will implement as many Shoes features as possible, but there are some that will not be possible because of the limitations of the browser environment (e.g. reading and writing to arbitrary files). The atom backend will extend the browser backend. Since this backend will run inside an atom shell, it will not be limited by the browser environment. The strategy is to implement as much as possible in the browser backend, and reuse browser code in the atom backend.\n\n\n### The backends\n\nThe `lib` directory contains the bulk of the code:\n\n- `lib\/bootstrap` contains files for bootstrapping the opal environment\n- `lib\/shoes\/browser` contains the browser backend\n- `lib\/shoes\/atom` contains the extensions to the browser backend for running in an atom shell\n- `lib\/shoes\/dsl.rb` contains a copy of `shoes\/dsl` from `shoes-core`, with a single modification to enable it to run on opal\n\nThere are a few auxiliary files that need to exist in order for apps to run using the browser and atom backends. You'll find these in `skeleton`.\n\n\n### Compiling an app\n\nThere isn't yet a great way to compile an app in some arbitrary location. However, there is a rake task for building all of the example apps, so you can drop an app `my_app.rb` into the `examples` directory and run\n\n    $ rake build:examples\n  \nNow your app will be built to `build\/my_app\/browser` and `build\/my_app\/atom`. Open them like this:\n\n        $ open build\/my_app\/browser\/index.html\n        $ \/Applications\/Atom.app\/Contents\/MacOS\/Atom build\/my_app\/atom\n\n\n\n### Specs\n\nThis repository contain a copy of the `shoes-core` specs. Eventually, these specs shoudl run unmodified for the atom backend, and with only minimal exclusions for the browser backend. There will be two spec runners:\n\n- `spec\/browser\/browser_runner.erb\/rb` runs shoes-core specs with the browser backend, and also specs for the browser backend itself\n- `spec\/atom\/atom_runner.erb.rb` (doesn't exist yet) will run shoes-core specs with the atom backend, and also specs for the atom backend (which should include most if not all of the specs for the browser backend)\n\nTo add specs to the browser suite, add the file to the runner, like this:\n\n```ruby\n# Enumerate the specs we want to run, so we can turn them on\/off easily.\n# These paths are relative to the load paths set in our spec task.\n# To run all of the specs, you'd replace this with\n#     Dir.glob('spec\/{browser,shoes}\/**\/*_spec.{rb,opal}')\n<%\n  active_specs = [\n    # Add more specs to this list :)\n    'shoes\/app_spec.rb',\n  ]\n%>\n```\n\nTo mark specs as not working with the browser backend, tag groups or examples with `:no_browser`, like this:\n\n```ruby\ndescribe 'fullscreen', :no_browser do\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\n```ruby\nit \"sets width\", :no_browser do\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\nRun specs like this:\n\n    $ rake spec:browser\n\n_**Note:** you may have to use `bundle exec rake spec:browser`, depending on your setup_\n\n\n### Samples\n\nThis repository includes a copy of the Shoes 4 samples. Ultimately, all of the samples should run with both the browser and the atom backends. The `samples\/README` file contains a list of working samples. To mark one as working, uncomment it in this file, like this:\n\n```\n# nks_self.rb\nnks_text_sizes.rb\n# nks_trurl.rb\n```\n\nThere are lots of rake tasks for running samples, taken from Shoes 4:\n\n```\nrake samples:bad                   # Run all non-working samples in random order\nrake samples:bad_list              # Create list of non-working samples\nrake samples:good[start_with]      # Run all working samples in alphabetical order\nrake samples:random                # Run all working samples in random order\nrake samples:subset[filename]      # Run all samples listed in samples\/filename\n```\n\nWhen you build samples and examples, the build directory will contain an index.html file with links to all of the browser versions of the build samples and examples.\n\n    $ open build\/index.html\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.

Each system support\nconverting from the system to a unified format and from the\nunified format back to the system format. The default system\nfollows the ISO standard (roughly - even the ISO standard say\nthat footwear size conversion isn't a solved problem yet,\nunfortunately).\n\nThe default collection of systems included (iso) follows the\nISO standardization (all systems convert to mondopoints and\nback for conversion) and implements the following systems (\neither according to spec, or best match possible):\n\n- Mondopoint (mm, mondo, mondopoints)\n- EU\n- UK\n- US\n- Brannock (currently the same as US)\n- cm\n- AU\n- MX\n\nSee each system file for comments and details. They are\nquite short and easy to read.\n\n#### Custom system collection\nTo implement your own systems, see the current\nimplementation(s) at `systems\/iso\/` (or `systems\/table\/`)\nfor reference. As long as the same structure is followed,\nit should be fairly trivial.\n\n## Table-based system (and backwards compatibility)\nThere's a table-based systems collection which can be used instead\nof iso:\n\n```javascript\nimport {convert} from 'shoe-size-converter';\nimport {table} from 'shoe-size-converter\/systems\/table';\n\nconvert({size: 36.5, system: 'eu'}, table);\n\/\/ => Same format as above - but with different conversion result\n```\n\nCurrently, it's based on the old sizing table, which means it can\nbe used to have the same conversion as version 0.0.5 and earlier,\nBUT with the new API.\n\nThe old conversion table can be found in the `size-tables.js\n` file, along with other conversion tables.\n","93":"# Welcome to Learn BDD playing dice book!\n\n## Author \n\nVal\u00e9rio Farias ([http:\/\/www.valeriofarias.com](http:\/\/www.valeriofarias.com))\n\n## Getting started\n\nDo you have to install the dependencies: \n\n\tprince, rdiscount, ultraviolet, tilt\n\nFirst you have to install prince from source:\nPrince: http:\/\/www.princexml.com\/download\/\n\nNow install the required packages and gems:\n    sudo aptitude install libonig2 libonig-dev\n    sudo gem install rdiscount ultraviolet tilt\n\nTo generate the book run: \n\n    rake pdf\n\nTo delete the last generated book run:\n\n\trake clean\n\nThis project has initially two versions of the book: English and Portuguese\n\nNow, just read the book and have fun!\n\n## License\n\nSource Code - MIT \/\nEbook - Creative Commons\n\n## Thanks for pull request (revision)\n\n[Marlon](http:\/\/github.com\/seronmarlon)\n","94":"Shoes Hack Note\n===============\n\nCurious about Shoes inside.

Many apps were made, and put into [The Shoebox](http:\/\/the-shoebox.org\/). But, one day, \\_why left. In his memory, Team Shoes assembled, and carried on making Shoes. They released Shoes 3 in late summer 2010.\n\n# So what do these Shoes look like?\n\nHere's a little Shoes app. It's a stopwatch!\n\n    Shoes.app :height => 150, :width => 250 do\n      background rgb(240, 250, 208)\n      stack :margin => 10 do\n        button \"Start\" do\n          @time = Time.now\n          @label.replace \"Stop watch started at #@time\"\n        end\n        button \"Stop\" do\n          @label.replace \"Stopped, \", strong(\"#{Time.now - @time}\"), \" seconds elapsed.\"\n        end\n        @label = para \"Press \", strong(\"start\"), \" to begin timing.\"\n      end\n    end\n\nHere's what it looks like:\n\n![shoes timer](https:\/\/github.com\/shoes\/shoes\/raw\/develop\/manual-snapshots\/simple-timer.png)\n\nPretty simple! For more samples, the manual, and a free book, check out [the Shoes website](http:\/\/shoesrb.com\/).\n\n# Using Shoes\n\nIf you'd like to use Shoes to develop some apps... awesome! It's super easy: Just go to the [downloads page on the Shoes website](http:\/\/shoesrb.com\/downloads) and download a copy of Shoes for your platform. Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux supported!\n\nAfter you install Shoes, run it! You'll get a window like this:\n\n![shoes main window](https:\/\/github.com\/shoes\/shoes\/raw\/develop\/static\/shoes_main_window.png)\n\nYou can then open any .rb file with Shoes code inside by choosing \"Open an App.\" It'll open it up and run it, right away.\n\nOnce you're happy with your app, you can choose \"Package an App\" to wrap up your app as a .exe, .app, or a .run. Then you can share it with someone without a pair of Shoes to call their own.\n\n# Making your own Shoes\n\nYou can make your own pair of Shoes with a little bit of elbow grease. Since there are different instructions on each platform, we've got a page up on the [Shoes development wiki](http:\/\/github.com\/shoes\/shoes\/wiki) about it. It's [right here](https:\/\/github.com\/shoes\/shoes\/wiki\/Building-Shoes).\n\n# Shoes Around the Web\n\nIf you want to keep up to date with what's going on with Shoes, you can find us in various places:\n\n* [Official Shoes Site](http:\/\/shoesrb.com\/)\n* [Source Code @ GitHub](http:\/\/github.com\/shoes\/shoes)\n* [Issue tracker @ GitHub](http:\/\/github.com\/shoes\/shoes\/issues)\n* [Mailing List](http:\/\/librelist.com\/browser\/shoes\/) (send an email to shoes@librelist.com to join)\n* [Twitter account](http:\/\/twitter.com\/shoooesrb)\n* [Facebook page](http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Shoes\/132605040125019)\n* IRC room on Freenode, #shoes\n\n# Helping out with Shoes\n\nSo you'd like to lend a helping hand, eh?

It connects to the real irc server with your\nnick and authentication details and let's you connect to it (with\npossibly no security, or different security).\n\nThis bouncer is written using {{{rcirc}}} to make the upstream\nconnection.\n\n\n== Making it work ==\n\nInstall this or install from the package on marmalade.\n\nYou need to install this in the place you want a bouncer. Not on your\nlocal machine (you probably don't want a bouncer there).\n\nThen define a config, you can customize the variable :\n\n{{{\nshoes-off-config\n}}}\n\nYou can also just setq it with something like:\n\n{{{\n(setq shoes-off-config\n      '((:username \"bouncer-username\"\n         :password \"bouncer-password\"\n         :server-alist ((\"irc.upstream.servername\"\n                         :nick \"nick-at-the-irc-network\"\n                         :port 6667\n                         :user-name \"user-to-connect-to-the-irc-network\"\n                         :password \"password-to-connect-to-the-irc-network\"\n                         :full-name \"Full Name\"\n                         :channels (\"#channel\" \"#otherchannel\"))))))\n}}}\n\nOnce that is done you need to start a {{{shoes-off}}} session. A\nsession is the bouncer's upstream connection to the IRC.\n\n{{{\nM-x shoes-off-start-session [RET] bouncer-username [RET]\n}}}\n\nWill start the bouncer session.\n\nAgain on the bouncer, you need to start the bouncer server:\n\n{{{\nM-x shoes-off-start [RET] 6901 [RET]\n}}}\n\n\/\/6901\/\/ is a listener TCP port. It could be anything. Choose wisely.\n\n\n== Auto-starting the bouncer server ==\n\nYou can auto-start the bouncer server on session start by configuring\nthe {{{shoes-off-server-port}}} variable to be the TCP port you want\nto start on.\n\n== Connecting to a running bouncer ==\n\nTo connect to the running bouncer you need to point your irc client at\nthe port you selected and use the username and password from the\n{{{shoes-off-config}}}.  Here's an {{{rcirc}}} example:\n\n{{{\n(rcirc-connect \n    \"my-bouncer.example.org\"                 ; hostname of bouncer\n    6901                                     ; port you started the bouncer on\n    \"nick-at-the-irc-network\"                ; the Nick to use (only used locally)\n    \"user-to-connect-to-the-irc-network\"     ; the username to connect to bouncer\n    \"Full Name\"                              ; full name (not used I think)\n    '(\"#channel\" \"#otherchannel\")            ; start channels (not used I think)\n    \"password-to-connect-to-the-irc-network\"); the password to connect to bouncer\n}}}\n\nThis will connect to the bouncer and everything \/\/should\/\/ work.\n\n== Multiple sessions ==\n\nMultiple upstream irc sessions can be bounced.  This is done by\nspecifying multiple servers in the server-alist and by connecting to\nservices with a qualified username.\n\nFor example, give the config:\n\n{{{\n(setq shoes-off-config\n      '((:username \"bouncer-username\"\n         :password \"bouncer-password\"\n         :server-alist \n             ((\"irc-one.upstream.servername\"\n                :nick \"nick-at-the-irc-network\"\n                :port 6667\n                :user-name \"user-name-1\"\n                :password \"password-1\"\n                :full-name \"Full Name\"\n                :channels (\"#channel\" \"#otherchannel\"))\n              (\"irc-two.upstream.servername\"\n                :nick \"nick-at-the-irc-network\"\n                :port 6667\n                :user-name \"user-name-2\"\n                :password \"password-2\"\n                :full-name \"Full Name\"\n                :channels (\"#channelhere\"))))))\n}}}\n\nYou can connect to these with:\n\n{{{\n(rcirc-connect \n    \"my-bouncer.example.org\"                 \n    6901\n    \"bouncer-nick\"\n    \"bouncer-username@irc-one.upstream.servername\"\n    \"Full Name\"\n    '(\"#channel\" \"#otherchannel\")\n    \"password\")\n}}}\n\nfor the second one:\n\n{{{\n(rcirc-connect \n    \"my-bouncer.example.org\"                 \n    6901\n    \"bouncer-nick\"\n    \"bouncer-username@irc-two.upstream.servername\"\n    \"Full Name\"\n    '(\"#channel\" \"#otherchannel\")\n    \"password\")\n}}}\n\n\nUnfortunately there is a bug at the moment, you can't do that exactly,\nyou must qualify the hostnames, probably by adding host alises to your\n\/etc\/hosts file.  I will find a way round this.\n\n== BUGS ==\n\nPlease report bugs or feature requests to\n[[https:\/\/github.com\/nicferrier\/shoes-off\/issues|GitHub]].\n\nI'm sure there are loads.\n\n== Security ==\n\n**WARNING** this DOES expose your password to the bouncer box.  I have\nmade little attempt to secure this right now.  IRC is not very\nsecure anyway.\n\nIf you want secure IRC for your team consider \n[[https:\/\/github.com\/nfisher\/SpikyIRC|SpikyIRC]]\n\n\n== FAQ ==\n\nQ How does shoes-off configuration\/authentication work?\n\nA `shoes-off-start-session' is called for a user, that calls\n`shoes-off\/get-config' with the username; this function may have a\nplugin implementation. It should return the username, password and\nserver-alist for the user. The server-alist are illustrated above.\n\nWhen shoes-off needs to check authentication it calls\n`shoes-off\/auth-check' with a username-spec and a password; this\nfunction may also have a plugin implementation. If succesfull it\nshould return a transformed name in the manner of\n`shoes-off\/auth-check-impl'.\n\nDifferent authentication systems can override the\n`shoes-off\/get-config-plugin' and `shoes-off\/auth-plugin' differently\nto ensure they can hold users and servers in whatever way they like.\n\n\n\n\n== Next steps ==\n\nA lot of work needs to go into automating the startup. But alternately\nI may just setup a hosting service for bouncers.\n\n== Why is it called 'Shoes Off'? ==\n\nBecause you have to take your shoes off on a bouncey castle.\n","101":"# Gait parameters analysis based on leg-and-shoe-mounted EcoIMU and LSTM\n\nThis repository contains **369 strides of walking data**, **a step event detector**, and **two stride length estimators**.\n\n#### Walking Data\nThe walking data is collected from six volunteers equipped with leg-and-shoe-mounted [EcoIMU](https:\/\/epl.tw\/ecomini\/). We attach five EcoIMUs to human body and collect motion data, including triaxial accelerations and triaxial angular rates, through BLE at a 125 samples per second data rate.\n\n![Collecting the walking data with EcoIMU through BLE](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/uc?id=1pmaJ2iuqjzIB8484h0qPcC60nP3A7AxC)\n\n#### Step Event Detector\nThe step event detector detects HS (heel-strike) and TO (toe-off) events through a neural network constructed with LSTM cells. The input is 6-axis IMU data collected from one left-shoe-mounted EcoIMU.\n\nWe implement this detector in *StepEvent_LSTM.py*.\n\n#### Stride Length Estimator\nWe propose two stride length estimators, which use *Mechanical Model* and *LSTM*, separately, to estimate stride lengths. \n* **Mechanical Model**: use the z-axis of gyroscope data to obtain the angles at joints through integration, and then we combine these angles with leg length and shoe length to calculate stride lengths. We implement this estimator in *StrideLength_MechanicalModel.py*.\n* **LSTM**: use 6-axis IMU data collected from all of the five leg-and-shoe-mounted EcoIMUs as the inputs to a neural network constructed with LSTM cells. We implement this estimator in *StrideLength_LSTM.py*.\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* install [cuDNN](https:\/\/docs.nvidia.com\/deeplearning\/sdk\/cudnn-install\/index.html)\n* install the following packages:\n```javascript\npip install numpy scipy matplotlib keras\npip install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu==1.5.0\n```\n\n### Clone and Run\n\nClone this repository and run the corresponding programs.

This example also \ndemonstrates usage of Fetch action as a lazy source for the accessories property of a Shoe. \n\n\nThe FindShoe action model `FindShoe.model.bxb` is backed by the Javascript `FindShoe.js`.\nNote the parallel relationship for FindAccessories model and js files.\n\nThe FindShoe action is a _Search_, which uses the inputs as constraints.\nThe FindAccessories action is actually a _Fetch_, which is a simple lookup of additional data from a single input.\n\nThe lazy-source, as its name implies, means that the data is only fetched when needed. In this example, it means that the fetch won't\nhappen until the `shoe-details-fragment.layout.bml` is rendered.\n\nFor more details, check https:\/\/bixbydevelopers.com\/dev\/docs\/reference\/type\/structure.property.lazy-source\n\n---\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n### Your Source for Everything Bixby\n* [Bixby Developer Center](http:\/\/bixbydevelopers.com) - Everything you need to get started with Bixby Development!\n* [Bixby News, Blogs and Tutorials](https:\/\/bixby.developer.samsung.com\/) - Bixby News, Tutorials, Blogs and Events\n\n### Guides & Best Practices\n* [Quick Start Guide](https:\/\/bixbydevelopers.com\/dev\/docs\/get-started\/quick-start) - Build your first capsule\n* [Design Guides](https:\/\/bixbydevelopers.com\/dev\/docs\/dev-guide\/design-guides) - Best practices for designing your capsules\n* [Developer Guides](https:\/\/bixbydevelopers.com\/dev\/docs\/dev-guide\/developers) - Guides that take you from design and modeling all the way through deployment of your capsules\n\n### Bixby Videos\n* [Bixby Developers YouTube Channel](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/bixbydevelopers) - Tutorial videos, Presentations, Capsule Demos and more\n\n### Bixby Podcast\n* [Bixby Developers Chat](http:\/\/bixbydev.buzzsprout.com\/) - Voice, Conversational AI and Bixby discussions \n\n### Bixby on Social Media\n* [@BixbyDevelopers](https:\/\/twitter.com\/bixbydevelopers) - Twitter\n* [Facebook](https:\/\/facebook.com\/BixbyDevelopers)\n* [Instagram](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bixbydevelopers\/)\n\n### Need Support?\n* Have a feature request?

We do not recommend installing scrapy system wide.\n\nInstead, we recommend that you install scrapy within a so-called \u201cvirtual environment\u201d (virtualenv).\n\nVirtualenvs allow you to not conflict with already-installed Python system packages (which could break some of your system tools and scripts), and still install packages normally with pip (without sudo and the likes).\n\nTo install it globally (having it globally installed actually helps here), it should be a matter of running:\n\n```\n$ [sudo] pip install virtualenv\n```\n\nInside virtual env install ProdirectScraper dependencies:\n\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Config Settings\nThese are the basic options:\n```\n# available currency EUR,USD,GBP\ncurrency =\n# Number of pieces to display in the email\npp =\n\n# mailer configuration options\nsmtp_host =\nmail_from =\nmail_to =\nsmtp_user =\nsmtp_pass =\nsmtp_port =\nsmtp_tls =\nsmtp_ssl =\n```\n\nAfter that edit the configuration specific to the category of product you would like to scrape.\n\nFor trainers:\n```\n#available sizes are from 4 to 12, e.g 4 or 4,5,10\nsize =\n\n```\n\nFor men's clothing:\n```\n# available options:  One size, ONE-SIZE, S\/M, L\/XL, S, M, L, XL, XXL\nsize =\n```\n\nFor women's clothing:\n```\n# available options: OSFM,One Size,8,10,12,14,16,7 - 10,4\u00bd - 7\u00bd,ONE-SIZE,32C,6,3\u00bd,4,4\u00bd,5,5\u00bd,6\u00bd,7,7\u00bd,XXS,XS,S,M,L,XL\nsize =\n```\n\n\n## Running the Spiders\n\nTo put our spider to work, go to the project\u2019s top level directory and run:\n\n```\nscrapy crawl SCRAPER\n```\nwhere \"SCRAPER\" must be one of the following:\n- trainers\n- mensclothing\n- womensclothing\n\nThis command runs the spider with name trainers, that will crawl http:\/\/www.prodirectselect.com\/ website and send mail with lowest prices, model description and link to trainers, which size is specified in configuration.ini \n","108":"## Under construction [![Build Status](https:\/\/travis-ci.org\/PragTob\/pomodoro_tracker.png?branch=master)](https:\/\/travis-ci.org\/PragTob\/pomodoro_tracker) [![Code Climate](https:\/\/codeclimate.com\/github\/PragTob\/pomodoro_tracker.png)](https:\/\/codeclimate.com\/github\/PragTob\/pomodoro_tracker)\n\nThis pomodoro tracker is still under construction. I use it to manage my day-to todos though so it's safe to try for the adventurous I'd say. :-)\n\nSo why this thing? It should work on every PC where shoes runs. You can create todo items with an estimation of the pomodori it will take to complete them. And then you can work on them. You will get the usual 25minutes work\/5 minute break. Signaled with a clock ticking down and when it's over an alarm clock sound.\n\nRight now everything is saved into YAML files. You may configure the path to that YAML file so that you can put it in your Dropbox (for instance) for easy syncinc across all your devices.\n\nThis is intentionally not a website\/Internet service. I truly love the web, but not everything needs to be online. That just means having another login, server, Internet connection etc... some things can be local and work wonderfully.\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![Pomodoro Tracker](https:\/\/rawgithub.com\/PragTob\/pomodoro_tracker\/master\/screenshot.png)\n","109":"= TwitterShoes \n\n* http:\/\/github.com\/pedromg\/twittershoes\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nruby script created to be a Twitter (http:\/\/www.twitter.com) client, \nthat uses Shoes.rb (http:\/\/code.whytheluckystiff.net\/shoes) to be run \non various platforms (Linux, MacOSX, Windows).

Taylor. All Rights Reserved\n * Prerequisites: IE10+, other modern browsers that support CSS flexbox and blob urls\n\n## McSandy's Features ##\nMcSandy isn't the only web-based, live preview editor out there. Here's what makes McSandy unique:\n \n + McSandy let you save your work into local storage\n + Your project gets a hashable url, so you can bookmark it: `mcsandy.html#myawesomeproject`\n + You can export your work into an HTML file (it's that <kbd>download<\/kbd> button)\n + You can drag HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files into the edit fields to edit them.\n + You can drag your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript fields to your desktop to save them\n + McSandy knows when you have an internet connection and uses any external libraries appropriately\n + McSandy is a single file: mcsandy.html\n + McSandy doesn't need an internet connection\n\n\n## Keyboard Shortcuts ##\n + <kbd>ctrl<\/kbd> + <kbd>shift<\/kbd> + <kbd>i<\/kbd>: Toggle information window\n + <kbd>ctrl<\/kbd> + <kbd>s<\/kbd>: save\n + <kbd>ctrl<\/kbd> + <kbd>r<\/kbd>: run\n + <kbd>ctrl<\/kbd> + <kbd>d<\/kbd>: download\n + <kbd>ctrl<\/kbd> + <kbd>l<\/kbd>: load\n + <kbd>ctrl<\/kbd> + <kbd>shift<\/kbd> + <kbd>e<\/kbd>: toggle editor\n + <kbd>ctrl<\/kbd> + <kbd>shift<\/kbd> + <kbd>p<\/kbd>:  toggle projects\n + <kbd>ctrl<\/kbd> + <kbd>shift<\/kbd> + <kbd>del<\/kbd>:   delete project\n + <kbd>ctrl<\/kbd> + <kbd>shift<\/kbd> + <kbd>+<\/kbd>:  New Project\n + <kbd>ctrl<\/kbd> + <kbd>shift<\/kbd> + <kbd>n<\/kbd>:  Open Editor panel in a new window\n + <kbd>ctrl<\/kbd> + <kbd>shift<\/kbd> + <kbd>h<\/kbd>: toggle Horizontal layout\n\n### The Technologies Behind McSandy ###\nMcSandy is an HTML5 application. It's using Vanilla JavaScript, but it makes use of three API's in particular\n + localStorage (for storing data)\n + `online` (for showing whether you have internet)\n + Blob URLs (for doing the live-preview in an iframe)\n + fileReader for reading and generating files\n + drag and drop (for dropping files into your edit areas)\n + [Eli Grey](http:\/\/eligrey.com\/blog\/post\/saving-generated-files-on-the-client-side)'s [filesaver.js](https:\/\/github.com\/eligrey\/FileSaver.js) is used for the export, until a McSandy-specific solution is developed. \n + CSS3's Flexbox module for layout. Flexbox is supported in IE10+ \n\n## Upcoming Features ##\nIf you'd like a feature, jump on over to the Issues page and request one. Label it as an enhancement and assign it to me. \n\n## FAQs ##\n###What's an SFWA? ###\n\nAn SFWA is a Single File Web Application. This means the entire application functions in a single html file. There are no dependencies on any external libraries. Once you've downloaded McSandy (mcsandy.html), you're ready to start coding. \n\n\n### How can I save my work? ###\nMcSandy uses `localstorage` to save your projects. You can save and delete any of your projects by clicking on the save button at the bottom, or by using the keyboard command <kbd>ctrl<\/kbd> + <kbd>s<\/kbd>\n\n### How can I get my work back? ###\nAt the bottom of McSandy, there's a select box where you can retrieve your old projects. Select the project and just click the <kbd>load<\/kbd> button. \n\nYou can also retrieve your projects as a hash in the URL: `mcsandy.html#my_project`. \n\nThis means that you can bookmark your projects!\n\n### How can I add external files? ###\nMcSandy gives you the option to load JavaScript libraries from Google's CDN. In the future, you'll be able to add your own JS Libraries, too. \n\n### How can I export my work? ###\nAt the bottom of McSandy is a <kbd>download<\/kbd> button. This will export your current project to a static HTML file. \n\n\n## License\nMcSandy is not open-sourced. \nCopyright and all rights reserved by Frank M.

See [www.shoooes.net][shoes].\n\n* An **educational** aid for teaching programming concepts.\n\n* An illustration of **object oriented programming principles**: _mapping_ the problem domain, _encapsulation_, _modularity_, _interface_.\n\n* A demo of modern **2D** computer graphics and interactivity.\n\n* A testament of iterative, **organic cultivating** of the code toward it's better self\n\n\nWhy?\n----\n\nBecause teaching programming concepts is hard.\n\nWhen you have to teach basics of programming -- _nota bene_ to humanities students -- things are sometimes too abstract. Particularly when you have to explain difference between various [programming paradigms][wiki_programming_paradigm] and why Object-Oriented Programming is (at least some) solution to \u201efragile code\u201c.\n\nThe principles are laid out in the code of `animals-oriented-on-objects.rb` file. But you cannot _see_ them. And you are not sure _why_ do you make those silly classes anyway.\n\nThings can be seen much clearly in the game. You suddenly know why a sheep is an _\u201eobject\u201c_ and why we say it has some _properties_ (like _position_, maybe?) and some _messages_ (like \u201eRun, baby, run!\u201c) can be sent to it.\n\nYou also know how to start writing code. You usually start with _something_. A `simple-bounce.rb` file from samples included with _Shoes_ in this case (see initial _commit_).\n\nThen you gradually build up the environment of your game: you make the pasture green and put a sheep on it. You make the sheep move. You add more sheep and make them move. You add a dog, and make the dog catch the sheep. And so on. In the end you \u201erefactor\u201c the syntax of the game, add documentation, things like that.\n\nAll of these **steps** are saved in Git repository tags 1 to 13, so you can easily do a `git checkout 1`, `git checkout 2` to see development of the code and [walk through it][src] slowly.\n\n_Shoes_ and _Ruby_ make all of this very, very easy. Ruby is probably the best language for teaching programming, for beginners and advanced alike. And with _Shoes_, you can just see everything.\n\n\nSetup\n-----\n\n1. Download the _Shoes_ platform from [www.shoooes.net\/downloads][shoesdl]\n\n2. Open the `sheep_in_your_shoes.rb` file in _Shoes_\n\n\nBinaries (not necessary up-to-date)\n------------------------------------\n\n* [Mac OS X](http:\/\/data.karmi.cz\/ffuk\/Sheep_In_Your_Shoes\/sheep_in_your_shoes.dmg \"DMG, 4.4MB\")\n* [Windows ](http:\/\/data.karmi.cz\/ffuk\/Sheep_In_Your_Shoes\/sheep_in_your_shoes.exe \"EXE, 2MB\")\n\n---\n\nWritten by Karel Minarik ([www.karmi.cz](karmi)).

To install all the dependencies run the following command in both backend and frontend\/web directory.\n\n      ```sh\n      yarn install\n      ```\n\n3. Change the import in `index.css` file to default ant design styles or customize your css in the `theme.less` file and generate your css with the following command in the `frontend\/web\/src\/styles` directory.\n\n      ```sh\n      lessc --js theme.less theme.css\n      ```\n\n      > **_NOTE:_** _Make sure you have installed `less` globally_\n\n4. Run the following command in  the backend directory to start both server and React app.\n\n      ```sh\n      yarn dev\n      ```\n\n5.

Including a generic Shapeoko 3 model and a Duet 3 Model. We are also using a generic CAD cover for the LCD screen that can be downloaded directly from thingiverse. All reference CAD models used are copied here with any other documentation and licenses that came with the file. \n\n   - *Jenkins Robotics CAD*\n    All released CAD models will be posted here on Github. Every CAD model made by us are given a part number (JRCNC###). Original files are created using fusion 360. Most files will also be given proper engineering drawings once a release version of the file is posted.\n    \n    &nbsp;\n2. **CODE**  \n   - *SDCARD*\n    This folder contains a copy of all they files located on our Duet 3 Motherboard SD Card. The system drive contains multiple subfolders each containing different gcode \/ system files. Before Copying\/referencing our  custom files it is best to upgrade the stock firmware and system files. The official Duet 3 releases can be found on GitHub.  [RepRap Files](https:\/\/github.com\/Duet3D \"Duet3D\").\n      \n   - *Macros*\n    The Macro folder contains all the additional system files needed for the Duet 3. Files are grouped by their function. \n     **Directions:**\n        - Upload any of the desired files. Then review the files and make any necessary  adjustment to the position points and the probe\/sensors numbers.  \n\n   - *Sys*\n    The System folder contains all the important system files needed for the Duet 3. Each file serves as important gcode files that configures the machine and provide necessary gcode for specific processes like tool changes. \n        **Directions:**\n        - Upload the following files: Config*, TFree, Tpost, Tpre, Zprobe, Lighthome, lighton. \n        - Config file is specific to each machine. and will require modification based on the wiring of your specific machine. Use our config file and our wire diagram as reference. \n        - The TFree\/Tpost\/Tpre and ZProbe are all required files to add support for ATC and Automatic Tool offset probe. Copy these files and adjust the position data as necessary. \n\n\n    &nbsp;\n3. **DIAGRAMS**\n   - *Jenkinc CNC Wire Diagram (JRCNCWD1)*\n    A wiring diagram is a simplified conventional pictorial representation of an electrical circuit. It shows the components of the circuit as simplified shapes, and the power and signal connections between the devices Reference the wire diagram to review how each electrical component is connected to the Duet board\n\n   - *Duet 3 Reference files*\n    Reference files are used to highlight specific information that useful for the operation, installation of the duet board.  Duet3D online wiki contains many more useful information and [Documentations](https:\/\/duet3d.dozuki.com\/ \"Duet3D\").\n  \n    &nbsp;\n4. **FUSION 360 POST PROCESSOR**\n     \n   - *JenkinsCNCReprap.cps*\n    A post processor is the link between the CAM system and your CNC machine. The Post Processor translated the CAM instruction including information like the toolpath data, the type of operation, and the desired spindle feeds\/speeds into the language that a CNC machine understands (gcode). Despite the fact that the DUET 3 runs RepRap Firmware, the standard RepRap post processor do not work for CNC machining. Our Custom post processor is based on the default RepRap post processor but fixes the gcode syntax errors and adds  Automatic Tool Change \/ Spindle Controls support. \n    **Directions:**\n      - Uploading file to Fusion 360 Cloud Storage [Personal-cloud]\n        With-in Fusion 360 open the project navigation panel. Under Libraries select \"Assets\", then select folder \"CAMPosts\" (if no folder exist then create one.) Upload the custom Post Processor within this folder for cloud storage. \n      - Create NC Program\n        After creating your CAD model select the \"Manufacturing Tab\" in Fusion 360. Complete the \"Setup\" process and the desired toolpaths. Create a new \"NC Program\".  Under \"Post Configuration \/ Library\" specify the location of the Post Processor File [personal-cloud recommended]. Under Post specify the desired file \"Jenkins CNC RepRap\". Adjust Post Properties if desired, then export gcode.  \n\n\n    &nbsp;\n5. **MANUALS**\n   - *Reference Materials*\n    The manuals folder contains reference material for different hadware apart of the CNC. \n      - The VFD Manual contains the custom settings specific for our spindle.\n      - Automatic Tool Changer (ATC) manual contains information required to \"run-in\" a new spindle to properly prepare it before running production\n      \n\n\n> Note: Updating the RepRap firmware should be done carefully. Uploading the updated ZIP file could erase custom gcode files. \n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n## Installation Instructions\n\n\nInstallation instructions can be found in the youtube video linked below \n \n\n ### Video link  be updated soon\n\n[![image alt text](http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/w-qWbZ5-IQw\/0.jpg)](https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLNTKXZ4hgP_jekZOWw05JcJtyseCdSsIV \"YouTube\")\n\n\n<!-- This is commented out.  \n\nThe following is a breakdown of the different folders and the files contained in them:\n\n\n```\ncd utils\nnode build.js\n```\n\n\nCreate a file with a `.zip` extension containing these files and directories:\n\n```\nmanifest.json\ncommon\/\nchrome\/\n```\n\n\nCreate a file with a `.xpi` extension containing these files and directories:\n\n```\nchrome.manifest\ninstall.rdf\ncommon\/\nfirefox\/\n```\n\n This is commented out. -->\n\n\n&nbsp;\n## Next Steps\n\n\nThis project is now completed.

Bees with hand-shaped hats on, rotating around a wheel to catch drips of honey. Adam\u2019s hand shoots up. ADAM Can anyone work on the Krelman? TRUDY Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it\u2019s done well, means a lot. There are over 3000 different bee occupations. But choose carefully, because you\u2019ll stay in the job that you pick for the rest of your life. The bees CHEER. ANGLE ON: Barry\u2019s smile dropping slightly. BARRY The same job for the rest of your life? I didn\u2019t know that. ADAM What\u2019s the difference? TRUDY And you\u2019ll be happy to know that bees as a species haven\u2019t had one day off in 27 million years. BARRY So you\u2019ll just work us to death? TRUDY (laughing) We\u2019ll sure try. Everyone LAUGHS except Barry. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 9. The tram drops down a log-flume type steep drop. Cameras flash, as all the bees throw up their hands.

The nectar from the pollen jocks is removed from their backpacks, and loaded into trucks on their way to Honex. A SMALL CROWD forms around the Patrol Bees. Each one has a PIT CREW that takes their nectar. Lou Loduca hurries a pit crew along: LOU LODUCA You guys did great! You\u2019re monsters. You\u2019re sky freaks! I love it! I love it! SCHOOL GIRLS are jumping up and down and squealing nearby. BARRY I wonder where those guys have just been? ADAM I don\u2019t know. BARRY Their day\u2019s not planned. Outside the hive, flying who-knows-where, doing who-knows-what. ADAM You can\u2019t just decide one day to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. BARRY Right. Pollen Jocks cross in close proximity to Barry and Adam. Some pollen falls off, onto Barry and Adam. BARRY (CONT\u2019D) Look at that. That\u2019s more pollen than you and I will ever see in a lifetime. ADAM (playing with the pollen) It\u2019s just a status symbol. I think bees make too big a deal out of it. BARRY Perhaps, unless you\u2019re wearing it, and the ladies see you wearing it. ANGLE ON: Two girl bees. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 12. ADAM Those ladies?

GIRL 2 (to Adam) And what were you doing during all of this? ADAM Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities. The girl swipes some pollen off of Adam with a finger. BARRY (re: pollen) I can autograph that if you want. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 13. JACKSON Little gusty out there today, wasn\u2019t it, comrades? BARRY Yeah. Gusty.

The honey farms truck starts to pull away. Barry uses the bungee cord to slingshot himself towards the truck. He lands on the windshield, where the wind plasters him to the glass. He looks up to find himself surrounded by what appear to be DEAD BUGS. He climbs across, working his way around the bodies. BARRY (CONT\u2019D) Oh my. What horrible thing has happened here? Look at these faces. They never knew what hit them. And now they\u2019re on the road to nowhere. A MOSQUITO opens his eyes. MOOSEBLOOD Pssst! Just keep still. BARRY What? You\u2019re not dead?

BARRY Well, we\u2019re all jammed in there. It\u2019s a close community. MOOSEBLOOD Not us, man. We\u2019re on our own. Every mosquito is on his own. BARRY But what if you get in trouble? MOOSEBLOOD Trouble? You're a mosquito. You're in trouble! Nobody likes us. They\u2019re just all smacking. People see a mosquito, smack, smack! BARRY At least you\u2019re out in the world. You must meet a lot of girls. MOOSEBLOOD Mosquito girls try to trade up; get with a moth, dragonfly...mosquito girl don\u2019t want no mosquito. A BLOOD MOBILE pulls up alongside.

KEN (CONT'D) Well well well, a royal flush. BARRY You\u2019re bluffing. KEN Am I? Ken flushes the toilet. Barry grabs the Emory board and uses it to surf. He puts his hand in the water while he\u2019s surfing. Some water splashes on Ken. BARRY Surf\u2019s up, dude! KEN Awww, poo water! He does some skate board-style half-pipe riding. Barry surfs out of the toilet. BARRY That bowl is gnarly. Ken tries to get a shot at him with the toilet brush. KEN Except for those dirty yellow rings. Vanessa ENTERS. VANESSA Kenneth! What are you doing? KEN You know what? I don\u2019t even like honey! I don\u2019t eat it! VANESSA We need to talk! \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 83. She pulls Ken out by his ear.

Ken RE-ENTERS. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 84. KEN I know it\u2019s got an aftertaste! I like it! BARRY (re: Ken) I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.

MONTGOMERY We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. ADAM (whispering to Vanessa) Now that\u2019s a good idea. (to Barry) You can really see why he\u2019s considered one of the very best lawyers-- Oh. Barry rolls his eyes. He gets up, takes the stand. A juror in a striped shirt APPLAUDS. MR. GAMMIL (whispering) Layton, you\u2019ve got to weave some magic with this jury, or it\u2019s going to be all over. Montgomery is holding a BOOK, \u201cThe Secret Life of Bees\u201d. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 85. MONTGOMERY (confidently whispering) Oh, don\u2019t worry Mr. Gammil. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don\u2019t like about bees. (to Gammil) You got the tweezers? Mr. Gammil NODS, and pats his breast pocket. MR. GAMMIL Are you allergic? MONTGOMERY Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Montgomery approaches the stand. MONTGOMERY (CONT\u2019D) Mr. Benson Bee. I\u2019ll ask you what I think we\u2019d all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? Montgomery points to Vanessa. BARRY We\u2019re friends. MONTGOMERY Good friends? BARRY Yes.

MONTGOMERY You\u2019re an illegitimate bee, aren\u2019t you Benson? ADAM He\u2019s denouncing bees! All the bees in the courtroom start to HUM. They\u2019re agitated. MONTGOMERY And don\u2019t y\u2019all date your cousins? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 87. VANESSA (standing, letting go of Adam) Objection!

I have been felled by a wing-ed beast of destruction. You see? You can\u2019t treat them like equals. They\u2019re strip-ed savages! Stinging\u2019s the only thing they know! It\u2019s their way! ANGLE ON: Adam, collapsed on the floor. Barry rushes to his side. BARRY Adam, stay with me. ADAM I can\u2019t feel my legs. Montgomery falls on the Bailiff.

JUDGE Please, I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! FADE TO: SEQ. 3400 - \u201cADAM AT HOSPITAL\u201d INT. HOSPITAL - STREET LEVEL ROOM - DAY PRESS PERSON #1 (V.O) The case of the honey bees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday, when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. Now here\u2019s Don with the 5-day. A NURSE lets Barry into the room. Barry CARRIES a FLOWER. BARRY Thank you. Barry stands over Adam, in a bed. Barry lays the flower down next to him. The TV is on. BARRY (CONT'D) Hey buddy. ADAM Hey. BARRY Is there much pain? Adam has a BEE-SIZED PAINKILLER HONEY BUTTON near his head that he presses. ADAM (pressing the button) Yeah...I blew the whole case, didn\u2019t I? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 89. BARRY Oh, it doesn\u2019t matter. The important thing is you\u2019re alive. You could have died. ADAM I\u2019d be better off dead. Look at me. Adam THROWS the blanket off his lap, revealing a GREEN SANDWICH SWORD STINGER. ADAM (CONT\u2019D) (voice cracking) They got it from the cafeteria, they got it from downstairs. In a tuna sandwich. Look, there\u2019s a little celery still on it. BARRY What was it like to sting someone? ADAM I can\u2019t explain it. It was all adrenaline...and then...ecstasy. Barry looks at Adam. BARRY Alright. ADAM You think that was all a trap? BARRY Of course. I\u2019m sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us, we\u2019re just a couple of bugs in this world. ADAM What do you think the humans will do to us if they win? BARRY I don\u2019t know. ADAM I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn\u2019t sound so bad. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 90. BARRY Adam, they check in, but they don\u2019t check out. Adam GULPS. ADAM Oh my. ANGLE ON: the hospital window. We see THREE PEOPLE smoking outside on the sidewalk. The smoke drifts in. Adam COUGHS. ADAM (CONT\u2019D) Say, could you get a nurse to close that window? BARRY Why? ADAM The smoke. Bees don\u2019t smoke. BARRY Right. Bees don\u2019t smoke. Bees don\u2019t smoke! But some bees are smoking. Adam, that\u2019s it! That\u2019s our case. Adam starts putting his clothes on. ADAM It is? It\u2019s not over? BARRY No. Get up. Get dressed. I\u2019ve got to go somewhere. You get back the court and stall. Stall anyway you can. CUT TO: SEQ. 3500 - \u201cSMOKING GUN\u201d INT.

ANGLE ON: Montgomery frustrated with Gammil, who\u2019s making a boat also. Monty crumples Gammil\u2019s boat, and throws it at him. JUDGE Mr. Flayman? ADAM Yes? Yes, Your Honor? JUDGE Where is the rest of your team? ADAM (fumbling with his swordstinger) Well, your honor, it\u2019s interesting. You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and as a result quite often we don\u2019t make very good time. I actually once heard a pretty funny story about a bee-- MONTGOMERY Your Honor, haven\u2019t these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court\u2019s valuable time? Montgomery rolls out from behind his table. He\u2019s suspended in a LARGE BABY CHAIR with wheels. MONTGOMERY (CONT'D) How much longer are we going to allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. JUDGE Mr. Flayman, I am afraid I am going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery\u2019s motion. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 92. ADAM But you can\u2019t. We have a terrific case. MONTGOMERY Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun. Barry bursts through the door. BARRY Hold it, your honor. You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. Vanessa ENTERS, holding a bee smoker Vanessa slams the beekeeper's SMOKER onto the judge\u2019s bench. JUDGE What is that? BARRY It\u2019s a Bee smoker. Montgomery GRABS the smoker. MONTGOMERY What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn\u2019t hurt a fly, let alone a bee. He unintentionally points it towards the bee gallery, KNOCKING THEM ALL OUT. The jury GASPS. The press SNAPS pictures of them. BARRY Members of the jury, look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or Non?\" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines in man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? Barry gestures dramatically towards Montgomery's racially mixed table. The BLACK LAWYER slowly moves his chair away. GAMMIL What are we going to do? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 93. MONTGOMERY (to Pross) He's playing the species card. Barry lands on the scale of justice, by the judge\u2019s bench. It balances as he lands. BARRY Ladies and gentlemen, please, FreeThese-Bees! ANGLE ON: Jury, chanting \"Free the bees\". JUDGE The court finds in favor of the bees. The chaos continues. Barry flies over to Vanessa, with his hand up for a \u201chigh 5\u201d. BARRY Vanessa, we won! VANESSA Yay! I knew you could do it. Highfive! She high 5\u2019s Barry, sending him crashing to the table. He bounces right back up. VANESSA (CONT'D) Oh, sorry. BARRY Ow!! I\u2019m okay. Vanessa, do you know what this means? All the honey is finally going to belong to the bees. Now we won\u2019t have to work so hard all the time. Montgomery approaches Barry, surrounded by the press. The cameras and microphones go to Montgomery. MONTGOMERY (waving a finger) This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson! You\u2019ll regret this. ANGLE ON: Barry\u2019s \u2018deer in headlights\u2019 expression, as the press pushes microphones in his face. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 94. PRESS PERSON 1 Barry, how much honey do you think is out there? BARRY Alright, alright, one at a time... SARAH Barry, who are you wearing? BARRY Uhhh, my sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. The Press follows Barry as he EXITS. ANGLE ON: Adam and Vanessa. ADAM (putting papers away) What if Montgomery\u2019s right? VANESSA What do you mean? ADAM We\u2019ve been living the bee way a long time. 27 million years. DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 3600 - \u201cHONEY ROUNDUP\u201d EXT. HONEY FARMS APIARY - MONTAGE SARAH (V.O) Congratulations on your victory. What are you going to demand as a settlement? BARRY (V.O) (over montage) First, we\u2019re going to demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then, we want to get back all the honey that was ours to begin with. Every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, big-headed, bad breath, stink-machine. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 95. I believe we\u2019re all aware of what they do in the woods. We will no longer tolerate derogatory beenegative nick-names, unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products, and la-dee-da tea-time human snack garnishments.

VANESSA And it\u2019s not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables...they all need bees. BARRY Well, that\u2019s our whole SAT test right there. VANESSA So, you take away the produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... BARRY The human species? VANESSA (clearing throat) Ahem! BARRY Oh.

Barry is on a laptop calculating flowers, pollen, number of bees, airspeed, etc. He does a \u201cStomp\u201d dance on the keyboard. BARRY Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job. I think this is going to work, Vanessa. VANESSA It\u2019s got to work. PILOT (V.O) Attention passengers. This is Captain Scott. I\u2019m afraid we have a bit of bad weather in the New York area. And looks like we\u2019re going to be experiencing a couple of hours delay. VANESSA Barry, these are cut flowers with no water.

There\u2019s a chance my entire species-- CO-PILOT (taking off his earphones) Ahhh! \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 112. The pilot grabs a \u201cDUSTBUSTER\u201d vacuum cleaner. He aims it around trying to vacuum up Barry. The co-pilot faces camera, as the pilot tries to suck Barry up. Barry is on the other side of the co-pilot. As they dosey-do, the toupee of the co-pilot begins to come up, still attached to the front. CO-PILOT (CONT'D) What are you doing? Stop! The toupee comes off the co-pilot\u2019s head, and sticks in the Dustbuster. Barry runs across the bald head. BARRY Wait a minute! I\u2019m an attorney! CO-PILOT Who\u2019s an attorney? PILOT Don\u2019t move. The pilot uses the Dustbuster to try and mash Barry, who is hovering in front of the co-pilot\u2019s nose, and knocks out the co-pilot who falls out of his chair, hitting the life raft release button.

VANESSA Is that another bee joke? BARRY No. No one\u2019s flying the plane. The AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER, BUD, speaks over the radio. BUD This is JFK control tower. Flight 356, what\u2019s your status? Vanessa presses a button, and the intercom comes on. VANESSA This is Vanessa Bloome. I\u2019m a florist from New York. BUD Where\u2019s the pilot? VANESSA He\u2019s unconscious and so is the copilot. BUD Not good. Is there anyone onboard who has flight experience? A BEAT. BARRY As a matter of fact, there is. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 114. BUD Who\u2019s that? VANESSA Barry Benson. BUD From the honey trial? Oh great. BARRY Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee. It\u2019s got giant wings, huge engines. VANESSA I can\u2019t fly a plane. BARRY Why not?

JEANETTE CHUNG Just a minute, Mr. Ditchwater, there\u2019s a honey bee on that plane. BUD Oh, I\u2019m quite familiar with Mr. Benson\u2019s work, and his no-account compadres.

Barry\u2019s family and Adam watch from their living room. Bees sitting on the street curb turn around to watch the TV. BARRY Mr. Ditchwater, the way we work may be a mystery to you, because making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you something about a small job. If you do it really well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That\u2019s why I want to get bees back to doing what we do best. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 117. Working together. That\u2019s the bee way. We\u2019re not made of Jello.

VANESSA (CONT\u2019D) Barry, what happened? BARRY (noticing the control panel) Wait a minute. I think we were on autopilot that whole time. VANESSA That may have been helping me. BARRY And now we\u2019re not! VANESSA (V.O.) (folding her arms) Well, then it turns out I cannot fly a plane. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8\/13\/07 118.

Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**\n\nIf you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\n\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.\n\nYou don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.\n\n## Learn More\n\nYou can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/getting-started).\n\nTo learn React, check out the [React documentation](https:\/\/reactjs.org\/).\n\n### Code Splitting\n\nThis section has moved here: [https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/code-splitting](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/code-splitting)\n\n### Analyzing the Bundle Size\n\nThis section has moved here: [https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/analyzing-the-bundle-size](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/analyzing-the-bundle-size)\n\n### Making a Progressive Web App\n\nThis section has moved here: [https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/making-a-progressive-web-app](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/making-a-progressive-web-app)\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\nThis section has moved here: [https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/advanced-configuration](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/advanced-configuration)\n\n### Deployment\n\nThis section has moved here: [https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/deployment](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/deployment)\n\n### `npm run build` fails to minify\n\nThis section has moved here: [https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)\n","152":"# mux-demux-shoe\n\nA mux demux connection through shoe!\n\nSimilar to [mux-demux-net][3], basically give you a MDM connection or a MDM server through shoe\n\n## Example Server\n\n    var shoe = require(\"mux-demux-shoe\")\n\n    var sock = shoe(function (stream) {\n        \/\/ stream from MuxDemux with the meta property set\n        if (stream.meta === \"one\") {\n            stream.on(\"data\", console.log.bind(console))\n        }\n    })\n\n    sock.install(someHttpServer, \"\/shoe\")\n\n## Example client\n\n    var shoe = require(\"mux-demux-shoe\")\n        , mdm = shoe(\"\/shoe\")\n\n    var one = mdm.createStream(\"one\")\n\n    one.write(\"hello world\")\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install mux-demux-shoe`\n\n## Tests\n\n`make test`\n\n## Contributors\n\n - Raynos\n\n## MIT Licenced\n\n  [1]: https:\/\/secure.travis-ci.org\/Raynos\/mux-demux-shoe.png\n  [2]: http:\/\/travis-ci.org\/Raynos\/mux-demux-shoe\n  [3]: https:\/\/github.com\/Raynos\/mux-demux-net","153":"# Challenge Jordan Shoes\r\n\r\n![preview](.\/JSimages\/ScreeshotJS.png)\r\n\r\n>Jordan Shoes Store\r\n\r\nDesafio 2 - Codel\u00e2ndia\r\n- Projeto criado com o intuito de agregar conhecimento de HTML e CSS.\r\n\r\n[\ud83d\udd17 Clique aqui para acessar](https:\/\/danieleewick.github.io\/Challenge-Jordan-Shoes\/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udee0Tecnologias\r\n\r\n- HTML\r\n- CSS\r\n- Git e GitHub\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udc8c Contato\r\n\r\ndanielelopesrj@gmail.com\r\n","154":"(Shoes Bundle for Texmate).based_on \"The Entirety of THE SHOES FAMILY?\"\n\nInstructions:\n\n  1) cd ~\/Library\/Application\\ Support\/Textmate\/Bundles\n  2) git clone git:\/\/github.com\/tiegz\/shoes-textmate-bundle.git Shoes.tmbundle\n","155":"","156":"# emergency-compliment\n> hey i like your shoes\n\n## up and running\n\n1.

It\nstarts at zero, and the buttons increment and decrement the count.\n\nFRP Implementation\n------------------\n`frp.rb` contains the same app, but written in an FRP style with [frappuccino](https:\/\/github.com\/steveklabnik\/frappuccino).\n\nWhat's different?\n-----------------\n\nHere's the diff:\n\n```diff\n--- reference.rb\t2013-04-23 12:05:50.000000000 +0200\n+++ frp.rb\t2013-04-23 15:01:17.000000000 +0200\n@@ -1,19 +1,40 @@\n+require 'frappuccino'\n+\n+class Button\n+  def initialize(event)\n+    @event = event\n+  end\n+\n+  def push\n+    emit(@event)\n+  end\n+end\n+\n Shoes.app :height => 150, :width => 250 do\n   background rgb(240, 250, 208)\n\n+  @plus = Button.new(:+)\n+  @minus = Button.new(:-)\n+\n+  @stream = Frappuccino::Stream.new(@plus, @minus)\n+\n+  @counter = @stream\n+              .map_stream(:+ => 1, :- => -1, :default => 0)\n+              .inject(0) {|sum, n| sum + n }\n+\n   stack :margin => 10 do\n     button \"+1\" do\n-      @count += 1\n-      @label.replace \"Current count: #@count\"\n+      @plus.push\n     end\n\n     button \"-1\" do\n-      @count -= 1\n-      @label.replace \"Current count: #@count\"\n+      @minus.push\n     end\n\n-    @count = 0\n+    @label = para \"Current count: #{@counter.to_i}\"\n\n-    @label = para \"Current count: #@count\"\n+    @counter.on_value do |value|\n+      @label.replace \"Current count: #{value}\"\n+    end\n   end\n end\n```\n\nLet's go over the differences:\n\nThe old buttons used to handle both incrementing the count, as well as\nreplacing the label. Now, the buttons do one thing: call a method on their\n`Button` reference. The streams handle responding to the press and doing\nthe update.\n\nWe have that `Button` classes. This is largely because of the way that\nShoes works; I _think_ I could get away from this, but in larger GUI apps\nyou'll have pure Ruby models anyway; putting logic into the UI stuff is\na general antipattern. It's nice for small things, which is one of the things\nShoes is great at, but bigger apps (like Hackety) get out of control really\nquickly.\n\nConstructing the count is no longer split between the two buttons, it's in the\n`#inject` call. This is a win: it went from being spread out among two places\nto being in just one place.\n\nThe update is now handled in one place as well: the `#on_value` callback we've\nadded to the stream. Same deal: this was in two places, now it's in one.\n\nThat's really it. Neat.\n\nRunning this yourself\n---------------------\n\nOkay, so I really wanted to make this mega-easy, so I included a\nGemfile... the issue is that Shoes 4 is still in flux, and so it\ndoesn't include binaries in the gem. Nuts. So, you'll have to\nclone down Shoes, and then run it from there. \n\nDon't forget: Shoes 4 is based on JRuby, so you have to be\nusing that.\n\nAnyway, here's what you have to do:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https:\/\/github.com\/shoes\/shoes4.git\n$ git clone https:\/\/github.com\/steveklabnik\/frappuccino.git\n$ git clone https:\/\/github.com\/steveklabnik\/frp_shoes.git\n$ cd frappuccino\n$ bundle\n$ rake install\n$ cd ..\/shoes4\n$ bundle\n$ bin\/swt-shoooes ..\/frp_shoes\/frp.rb\n```\n","160":"nike-bot\n========\n\nA bot to buy shoes based on Nike's twitter posts (for Dimitri)\n\nCurrent version 1.0\n\nGoing to release 2.0 at some point (hopefully) that optionally takes billing info and allows more than one purchaser (maybe an icon too).\n","161":"# shose_projects\n\nA new Flutter project.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis project is a starting point for a Flutter application.\n\nA few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:\n\n- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https:\/\/docs.flutter.dev\/get-started\/codelab)\n- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https:\/\/docs.flutter.dev\/cookbook)\n\nFor help getting started with Flutter development, view the\n[online documentation](https:\/\/docs.flutter.dev\/), which offers tutorials,\nsamples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.\n","162":"# Talaria\n\nThe flying shoes of Hermes.

Mac users can use the binary found [here](http:\/\/ffmpegmac.net\/) or install using [homebrew](http:\/\/brew.sh\/).\n* Join your drones wifi network.\n* Run\n\n```\ncd shoes4\nbin\/shoes ..\/talaria\/talaria.rb\n```\n\n* Fly and enjoy the view!\n\n## Key configuration\n\nThe key configuration is built for indoor control and immediately stops the drone if no key is pressed. The current key configuration is:\n\n* `t`: take off\n* `g`: land\n* `<SPACE>`: emergency toggle (immediately switches off the drone!)\n* `c`: switch camera signal between front and bottom camera\n\n* `<UP>`: fly upwards\n* `<DOWN>`: fly downwards\n* `<LEFT>`: turn left\n* `<RIGHT>`: turn right\n\n* `w`: forward\n* `s`: backward\n* `a`: bank left\n* `d`: bank right\n\n* `h`: flip left (not implemented)\n* `j`: flip backward (not implemented)\n* `k`: flip forward (not implemented)\n* `l`: flip right (not implemented)\n\n## Controller Support\n\nTalaria has support for PS3 controllers through `javahidapi`. To connect a controller to OS X, see [this gist](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/statico\/3172711). Linux should behave similar. The controller will be automatically detected if present.\n\nConfiguration:\n\n* `L2`: take off\n* `R2`: land\n* `X`: emergency toggle\n* `L1`: front camera\n* `R1`: bottom camera\n\n* `left analog stick`: forward\/backward, bank left\/right\n* `right analog stick`: up\/down, turn left\/right\n\n* `d-pad`: flips (not implemented)\n\n## Warning\n\nWhen playing around, lower the speed settings in `lib\/indoor_control.rb`. If your app crashes, the drone remembers the last settings and will be flying in the last direction without control.\n\nAlso, try the emergency toggle right after first take off to get a feel for it.\n\n## Pull requests\n\nAs long as Travis does not support drones and external controllers, I accept pull requests in good faith for just about anything.\n\n## License\n\nMIT, see LICENSE.md for details.\n","163":"# Shoestring\n\nShoestring is a handy tooling framework for websites big and small.

websocket streaming in the browser\nwith angularjs.\n\nThis module wraps the ```shoe``` library so that any ```$scope``` mutations are\ncorrectly wrapped with ```$rootScope.$apply``` calls so model changes are\ninstantly reflected in the view.\n\n## Installation\n\n### npm\n\nIf you're using [browserify](https:\/\/github.com\/substack\/node-browserify) then\ninstall via npm:\n\n```\n$ npm install angularjs-shoe\n```\n\nand require ```angularjs-shoe``` in your ```browserify``` code:\n\n``` js\nrequire('angularjs-shoe');\n```\n\n### bower\n\nIf you're using [bower](http:\/\/bower.io) then install using the bower command\nline:\n\n```\n$ bower install angularjs-shoe\n```\n\n### Old school\n\nIf you just want to use the client library without a package manager then\nsimply include the ```build\/angularjs-bower.js``` or\n```build\/angularjs-bower.min.js``` file into your HTML:\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Example<\/title>\n  <\/head>\n  <body>\n    <!-- AngularJS needs to be included before -->\n    <script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/\/ajax.googleapis.com\/ajax\/libs\/angularjs\/1.0.7\/angular.min.js\"><\/script>\n\n    <!-- Then you can include the angularjs-shoe module from your project -->\n    <script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/scripts\/angularjs-bower.min.js\"><\/script>\n\n    <!-- Then your regular angular code -->\n    <script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/scripts\/client.js\"><\/script>\n  <\/body>\n<\/html>\n```\n\n## Using angularjs-shoe from your AngularJS controllers\n\nTo use shoe from your controllers you simply define ```eugeneware.shoe```\nas a module dependency for your app and then you can use dependency injection\nto refer to the ```shoe``` or ```reconnect``` variables:\n\n``` js\n\/\/ client.js\nvar app = angular.module('MyApp', ['eugeneware.shoe']);\n\napp.controller('MyCtrl', function ($scope, shoe) {\n  $scope.items = [];\n\n  var stream = shoe('\/invert');\n  stream.on('data', function (msg) {\n    \/\/ you can mutate your $scope here and it will automatically be wrapped in\n    \/\/ a $rootScope.$apply:\n    $scope.items.push(msg);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nIf you want to use ```shoe``` and have it automatically reconnect to the\n```websocket``` server when there is a network disconnection then use the\n```reconnect``` function:\n\n``` js\n\/\/ client.js\nvar app = angular.module('MyApp', ['eugeneware.shoe']);\n\napp.controller('MyCtrl', function ($scope, reconnect) {\n  $scope.items = [];\n\n  reconnect(function (stream) {\n    stream.on('data', function (msg) {\n      \/\/ you can mutate your $scope here and it will automatically be wrapped in\n      \/\/ a $rootScope.$apply:\n      $scope.items.push(msg);\n    });\n  })\n  .connect('\/invert');\n});\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nThe browser files ```build\/angularjs-shoe.js``` and ```build\/angularjs-shoe.min.js```\nalready have ```shoe``` and ```reconnect``` bundled with them so you don't need\nto include them yourself.\n","168":"# Shoe Store

App](https:\/\/github.com\/facebook\/create-react-app).\n\n## Available Scripts\n\nIn the project directory, you can run:\n\n### `yarn start`\n\nRuns the app in the development mode.\\\nOpen [http:\/\/localhost:3000](http:\/\/localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\n\nThe page will reload if you make edits.\\\nYou will also see any lint errors in the console.\n\n### `yarn test`\n\nLaunches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\\\nSee the section about [running tests](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/running-tests) for more information.\n\n### `yarn build`\n\nBuilds the app for production to the `build` folder.\\\nIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\n\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\\\nYour app is ready to be deployed!\n\nSee the section about [deployment](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/deployment) for more information.\n\n### `yarn eject`\n\n**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can\u2019t go back!**\n\nIf you aren\u2019t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\n\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you\u2019re on your own.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn\u2019t be useful if you couldn\u2019t customize it when you are ready for it.\n\n## Learn More\n\nYou can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/getting-started).\n\nTo learn React, check out the [React documentation](https:\/\/reactjs.org\/).\n\n### Code Splitting\n\nThis section has moved here: [https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/code-splitting](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/code-splitting)\n\n### Analyzing the Bundle Size\n\nThis section has moved here: [https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/analyzing-the-bundle-size](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/analyzing-the-bundle-size)\n\n### Making a Progressive Web App\n\nThis section has moved here: [https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/making-a-progressive-web-app](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/making-a-progressive-web-app)\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\nThis section has moved here: [https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/advanced-configuration](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/advanced-configuration)\n\n### Deployment\n\nThis section has moved here: [https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/deployment](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/deployment)\n\n### `yarn build` fails to minify\n\nThis section has moved here: [https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/create-react-app\/docs\/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)\n","169":"# Shoe Store\n\n## Synopsis\n\nAldo Shoes is having a huge flash sale online. You provide support to the inventory department. They want to react real-time to various inventory problems as they arise.\n\nYou adjust the inventory whenever a new sale is completed. The return value includes the store, the shoe model and the inventory left for that shoe model in the store.\n\n```\n{\n  'store' => 'ALDO Ste-Catherine',\n  'model' => 'ADERI',\n  'inventory' => 10,\n}\n```\n\n`ALDO Ste-Catherine` store sold a pair of `ADERI` shoes. `ALDO Ste-Catherine` now has 10 pairs of `ADERI` left.\n\n## Goal\n\n**Design an interface that would allow the inventory department to monitor Aldo's stores and shoes inventory.**\n\nHope you\u2019ll have fun with this little test. I know I had designing it.\nGo wild. It can be anything you want. I\u2019ve seen results printed to console, displayed on a webpage, and even someone who did periodical database dumps.\n\nHere are a few ideas if you need an extra challenge:\n\n- Add some sort of alerting system, e.g. When a shoe model at a store goes too low, or too high.\n- Add a REST JSON API, or GraphQL\n- Suggest shoe transfers from one store to another according to inventory\n- Your own crazy idea!\n\nShare your repository with us when you\u2019re done.\n\nHappy Hacking :)\n\n## Installation\n\nThis projects uses the popular library `websocketd` to send messages.\n\nIf you're on a Mac, you can install `websocketd` using [Homebrew](http:\/\/brew.sh\/). Just run `brew install websocketd`. For other operating systems, or if you don't want to use Homebrew, check out the link below.\n\n**[Download for Linux, OS X and Windows](https:\/\/github.com\/joewalnes\/websocketd\/wiki\/Download-and-install)**\n\nNote that a Ubuntu 64-bit version is already bundled here `bin\/websocketd` for convenience.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Inventory Server\n\nYour WebSocket Server is the tap that aggregates inventories from all stores.\n\nYou can run it directly from your own machine.\n\nRun the following to start tapping into the inventory events.\n\n```\n(bin\/)websocketd --port=8080 ruby inventory.rb\n```\n\nYou now have an active connection to their stores opened on port 8080.\n\n### Start listening on each event\n\nListen and react on each event using a WebSocket client.\n\nVarious implementations are at your disposal. Whatever floats your boat.\n\nThey all work the same way. Provide a method or a block to be executed whenever a new event occurs.\n\nHere are two examples for our favorite languages:\n\n#### Javascript\n\nOpen a console on a non-secured page:\n\n```\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws:\/\/localhost:8080\/');\n\nws.onmessage = function(event) {\n  console.log(event.data);\n};\n```\n\n#### Ruby\n\n##### Installation\n\n```\ngem install faye-websocket\ngem install eventmachine\n```\n\n##### Example\n\n```\nrequire 'faye\/websocket'\nrequire 'eventmachine'\nrequire 'json'\n\nEM.run {\n  ws = Faye::WebSocket::Client.new('ws:\/\/localhost:8080\/')\n\n  ws.on :message do |event|\n    p JSON.parse(event.data)\n  end\n}\n```\n","170":"# flutter_ecommerce_shoe_app\n\nEcommerce shoe app flutter\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis project is a starting point for a Flutter application.\n\nA few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:\n\n- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https:\/\/flutter.dev\/docs\/get-started\/codelab)\n- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https:\/\/flutter.dev\/docs\/cookbook)\n\nFor help getting started with Flutter, view our\n[online documentation](https:\/\/flutter.dev\/docs), which offers tutorials,\nsamples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.\n","171":"","172":"<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\".\/.images\/logo.svg\" height=\"180\">\n<\/p>\n\n# Nike\/Snkrs Bot\nA python automation script to buy new release snkrs from Nike's website.\n\n## Instalation:\nIn order to use this script you will need to have [Python 3](https:\/\/www.python.org\/downloads\/) installed in your machine as well as set in the PATH, then you just need to clone this repository, install the requirements and you are free to go :tada: :\n\n```bash\n# clone the repository\ngit clone https:\/\/github.com\/guiguat\/nike-bot\n\n# go inside the cloned folder\ncd nike-bot\n\n#install the requirements\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Usage:\n ```\npython run.py [-b | --browser <browser name>] [-e | --email <email>] [-p | --password <password>] [-s | --size <size1>,<size2>] [...optional]\n\noptional: [-n | --name <snkr name>]\n ```\n\nMade with \u2665 by [Guilherme Guatura](https:\/\/github.com\/guiguat) & [Iuri Corr\u00eaa](https:\/\/github.com\/iuri-pdista)","173":"This project is no longer maintained.

How can a novel be written in only six words? While the debate rages on, we need no convincing. Six word stories can be as powerful as a thousand page novel. This power comes from the reader's imagination, the most powerful thing in the world.\n\n\n## Home Page\n![Home Page](\/imgs\/home.png)\n\nThis app allows users to read and write six word stories. Each story gets processed by the sentiment.js algorithm and then assigned emotional value, displayed below the story.

The topic is something I have always been passionate about and I'm excited to get this app in the hands of users equally as excited about short fiction.\n\nThis was also my first full-fledged React App, so I definitely spent lots of time just getting familiar with the framework and its quirks.\n\n### Future Development\n\nI hope to continue developing this project to include the following:\n* User Profiles that attach to social media platforms.\n* Options to write longer stories.\n* Ability to comment and discuss stories.\n\n### Technologies Used\n* React\n* Node.js\n* Express\n* Postgresql\n\n### Local Installation\n\nIf you'd like to hack away at this project, great! Go ahead and fork the frontend or backend repo linked at the bottom of this README, clone it to your machine, then run:\n\n`npm install` - for all the dependencies\n`npm test` - (frontend) for cypress in-browser tests.\n`npm test` - (backend) to run nodemon dev server.\n`npm test-in-terminal` - for cypress CL tests.\n`npm start` - to spin up local server.\n\nHappy Hacking!\n\n\n\nLink to [front-end](https:\/\/sixwordstories.herokuapp.com\/).\nLink to [back-end](https:\/\/sixwordstories-server.herokuapp.com\/).\n-Endpoints are at \"\/stories\" and \"\/authors\"\n\n[Front-end Repo](https:\/\/github.com\/TheMoonMoth\/sws-frontend)\n[Back-end Repo](https:\/\/github.com\/TheMoonMoth\/sws-backend)\n\n### License\n\nMIT\n","187":"\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u5df1\u5199\u7684\u767b\u8bb0\u4e70\u978b\u5c0f\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u5fae\u4fe1\u516c\u4f17\u53f7\u300a\u676d\u5dde\u5927\u53a6NK\u4f53\u9a8c\u5e97\u300b\uff0c\u6bcf\u5468\u53d1\u552e\u9650\u91cfAJ\n\n\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u767b\u8bb0\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u53ef\u767b\u8bb02\u30013\u4eba\uff0c\u591a\u4eba\u540c\u65f6\u5e76\u53d1\u767b\u8bb0\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u62fc\u624b\u901f\u767b\u8bb0\n\n\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u6309\u7167\u8bf4\u660e\u586b\u5199env.yaml\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c06\u5fae\u4fe1\u516c\u4f17\u53f7\u767b\u8bb0\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7801\u622a\u56fe\u653e\u5230\u9879\u76ee\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u4fee\u6539\u767b\u8bb0\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u811a\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u767b\u8bb0\n\n\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u4f60\u7684\u7535\u8111\u8981\u51c6\u5907\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\n\n1.\u5b89\u88c5python\u73af\u5883\n\n2.\u4f60\u7684\u7535\u8111\u6709\u8c37\u6b4c\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\uff0c\u5b89\u88c5\u8c37\u6b4c\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u5bf9\u5e94\u7248\u672c\u7684webdriver\n\u6ce8\uff1a\u7531\u4e8e\u767b\u8bb0\u65b9\u5f0f\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\n","188":"# React Shoe\n\n# Sobre o projeto\n\nReact Shoe \u00e9 um projeto desenvolvido com o intuito de estudar a tecnologia [Three.js](https:\/\/threejs.org\/) para objetos em 3d e [framer motion](https:\/\/www.framer.com\/motion\/) para anima\u00e7\u00f5es 2d.\n\n# Layout\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\".\/.github\/imgs\/SiteMockup.png\" alt=\"Mockup image\"\/>\n<\/p>\n\n# \ud83d\udee0 Tecnologias\n\nAs seguintes ferramentas foram usadas na constru\u00e7\u00e3o do projeto:\n\n- [framer-motion](https:\/\/www.framer.com\/motion\/)\n- [polished](https:\/\/polished.js.org\/)\n- [react-confetti](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/react-confetti)\n- [styled-components](https:\/\/styled-components.com\/)\n- [zustand](https:\/\/github.com\/pmndrs\/zustand)\n\n# \ud83d\ude80 Como executar o projeto\n\n## Pr\u00e9-requisitos\n\nAntes de come\u00e7ar, voc\u00ea vai precisar ter instalado em sua m\u00e1quina as seguintes ferramentas:\n\n- [Git](https:\/\/git-scm.com)\n- [Node.js](https:\/\/nodejs.org)\n- [VSCode](https:\/\/code.visualstudio.com) ou outro editor de codigos\n\n```bash\n# Clone este reposit\u00f3rio\n$ git clone https:\/\/github.com\/Leandro-Goncalves\/react-shoe\n# Acesse a pasta do projeto no seu terminal\/cmd\n$ cd react-shoe\n\n# Instale as depend\u00eancias\n$ npm install\n# ou\n$ yarn\n\n# Execute a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o em modo de desenvolvimento\n$ npm run dev\n# ou\n$ yarn dev\n\n# A aplica\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 aberta na porta:3000 - acesse http:\/\/localhost:3000\n```\n\n---\n\n# Author\n\nFeito com \u2764\ufe0f por Leandro Gon\u00e7alves [Entre em contato!](mailto:leandrogoncalvespr@hotmail.com)\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Leandro-Goncalves\/\">\n  <img\n    width=\"150px\"\n    src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Leandro-Goncalves.png\"\n    alt=\"\"\n  \/>\n <br \/>\n <sub><b>Leandro Gon\u00e7alves<\/b><\/sub><\/a>\n\n---\n","189":"# <a name=\"title\"><\/a> Nameit! \"Give it a name, why dont'cha?\"\n\n[![Gem Version](https:\/\/badge.fury.io\/rb\/nameit.png)](http:\/\/badge.fury.io\/rb\/nameit)\n[![Build Status](https:\/\/secure.travis-ci.org\/fnichol\/nameit.png)](http:\/\/travis-ci.org\/fnichol\/nameit)\n[![Code Climate](https:\/\/codeclimate.com\/github\/fnichol\/nameit.png)](https:\/\/codeclimate.com\/github\/fnichol\/nameit)\n[![Dependency Status](https:\/\/gemnasium.com\/fnichol\/nameit.png)](https:\/\/gemnasium.com\/fnichol\/nameit)\n\nNameit is a small zero-dependency library and tool that helps you generate a random name for a project, database, session--you decide.

Below is the website workflow (which was designed using [Creately](https:\/\/creately.com\/)).  \n\n![The website's structure](readme-testing-files\/readme\/structure.png \"The website's structure\")   \nThere's a clear page access separation between unregistered users and registered users. While unregistered users can still purchase products and receive the confirmation via email, they are not able to:  \n- View their order history  \n- Give reviews (and edit or delete their reviews accordingly)  \n- Make a favorite list of products.  \n\nThose features mentioned are available for registered users.  \n\n[Back to top &uarr;](https:\/\/github.com\/dissyulina\/shoesandmore#shoes-and-more)  \n\n<br\/>  \n\n### **D. Skeleton Plane**  \nWireframes were created using Figma to design the navigation and interface of the website. The wireframes were created only for desktops, which then will be transformed into high fidelity mock-ups in various device sizes (see Surface Plane).  \n\n- [Wireframe for Home page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/wireframes\/wireframe-home.png) \n- [Wireframe for Products page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/wireframes\/wireframe-products.png)  \n- [Wireframe for Individual Product page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/wireframes\/wireframe-individual-product.png)  \n- [Wireframe for Favorites page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/wireframes\/wireframe-favorites.png)  \n- [Wireframe for Shopping Bag page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/wireframes\/wireframe-shoppingbag.png)  \n- [Wireframe for Checkout page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/wireframes\/wireframe-checkout.png)  \n- [Wireframe for Profile page (Update user's information)](readme-testing-files\/readme\/wireframes\/wireframe-profile-updateinfo.png)  \n- [Wireframe for Profile page (View order history)](readme-testing-files\/readme\/wireframes\/wireframe-profile-orderhistory.png)  \n- [Wireframe for Profile page (Reviews)](readme-testing-files\/readme\/wireframes\/wireframe-profile-reviews.png)  \n- [Wireframe for Articles page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/wireframes\/wireframe-articles.png)  \n- [Wireframe for Individual Article page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/wireframes\/wireframe-individual-article.png)  \n- [Wireframe for Contact page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/wireframes\/wireframe-contact.png)  \n- [Wireframe for Add \/ Edit Review page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/wireframes\/wireframe-add-edit-review.png)  \n- [Wireframe for Sign Up page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/wireframes\/wireframe-signup.png)  \n- [Wireframe for Log In page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/wireframes\/wireframe-login.png)  \n\n<br\/>  \n\n### **E. Surface Plane**  \nHigh fidelity mock-ups were created using Figma as well for better and clearer visualization before coding, and also to check if the color scheme and images match and work great together. This has allowed the developer to concentrate solely on the development part (front end and back end), as the design has already been made with such details. The high-fidelity mock-ups were created in three different device sizes - desktop, tablet, and mobile.   \n\n- [High Fidelity Mock-up for Home page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/high-fidelity-mockups\/mockup-home.png)  \n- [High Fidelity Mock-up for Products page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/high-fidelity-mockups\/mockup-products.png)  \n- [High Fidelity Mock-up for Individual Product page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/high-fidelity-mockups\/mockup-individual-product.png)  \n- [High Fidelity Mock-up for Favorites page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/high-fidelity-mockups\/mockup-favorites.png)  \n- [High Fidelity Mock-up for Shopping Bag page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/high-fidelity-mockups\/mockup-shoppingbag.png)  \n- [High Fidelity Mock-up for Checkout page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/high-fidelity-mockups\/mockup-checkout.png)  \n- [High Fidelity Mock-up for Profile page (Update user's information)](readme-testing-files\/readme\/high-fidelity-mockups\/mockup-profile-updateinfo.png)  \n- [High Fidelity Mock-up for Profile page (Order History)](readme-testing-files\/readme\/high-fidelity-mockups\/mockup-profile-orderhistory.png)  \n- [High Fidelity Mock-up for Profile page (Reviews)](readme-testing-files\/readme\/high-fidelity-mockups\/mockup-profile-reviews.png)  \n- [High Fidelity Mock-up for Articles page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/high-fidelity-mockups\/mockup-articles.png)  \n- [High Fidelity Mock-up for Individual Article page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/high-fidelity-mockups\/mockup-individual-article.png)  \n- [High Fidelity Mock-up for Contact page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/high-fidelity-mockups\/mockup-contact.png)  \n- [High Fidelity Mock-up for Add \/ Edit Review page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/high-fidelity-mockups\/mockup-add-edit-review.png)  \n- [High Fidelity Mock-up for Sign Up page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/high-fidelity-mockups\/mockup-signup.png)  \n- [High Fidelity Mock-up for Log In page](readme-testing-files\/readme\/high-fidelity-mockups\/mockup-login.png)  \n\n#### **Color Scheme**  \nThe overall color theme of the website was natural earthy colors, which have relaxed and comforting influences and encourage feelings of warmth and calmness. Using [Coolors](https:\/\/coolors.co), I started with beige (#E8DCD5) and brown (#644536), and generated one more color that compliments them both - the result was a salmon color (#B2675E). I also found a hero image that fits the overall theme and colors accordingly.   \n![The color scheme](readme-testing-files\/readme\/color-scheme.png \"The color scheme\")  \n\n#### **Typography**  \nAll of the fonts were sourced from [Google Fonts](https:\/\/fonts.google.com).   \n- Main font: Noto Sans   \n   Noto Sans is a sans-serif font, used as the main font, for all paragraphs and buttons. Open Sans was chosen because it has a modern and clean style.  \n- Secondary font: DM Serif Display    \n   DM Serif Display is a serif font, used as the headers font on the Home page, in order to contrast them with the serif font.  \n\n\n#### **Design Changes on The Final Product**  \nWhile I relied heavily on these Wireframes in order to maintain the desired design, there are several differences between the Mockups and the final product:  \n- I changed the logo to a new one that's thicker and easier to spot, as the previous logo in the mockups was too thin and didn't look good on small devices.  \n- In the wireframes and mockups, there was a subscription to the newsletter box. I decided not to include this subscription to the newsletter functionality on the final product due to time constraints.  \n- The color #B2675E was changed to a slightly dark color #A5554C, because it didn't have enough contrast when paired with white text.  \n- Minor things like buttons colors and image differences were purely design choices that were taken during the website development.  \n\n[Back to top &uarr;](https:\/\/github.com\/dissyulina\/shoesandmore#shoes-and-more)  \n\n<br\/>  \n\n## **DATABASE DESIGN**    \n\nThe database schema was designed using [drawsql](https:\/\/drawsql.app\/). The database was first managed using SQLite during the development process, then Postgres in production with Heroku.   \n![The database schema](readme-testing-files\/readme\/database-schema.png \" The database schema\")  \n\n- **Category model**   \n   - Stores category name for a product. The categories, in this case, are Women, Men, and Kids.  \n   - Name field: the name used for database purposes.  \n   - Friendly_name field: the name used for display.  \n\n- **Subcategory model**   \n   - Stores subcategory name for a product. The subcategories in the database are Sandals, Sneakers, Oxfords, Heels, Boots, Mules, Flats, Outdoors, Loafers, Slippers, Sale, Accessories, and New Arrivals.  \n   - The Category model and Subcategory model have no relationship. I decided not to define a relationship\/ pairing between them to make it more flexible. Both are fully independent of each other.  \n   - Name field: the name used for database purposes.  \n   - Friendly_name field: the name used for display.  \n   \n- **Product model**   \n   - Stores detailed information about a product.  \n   - Category field: the category of the product, a foreign key from the Category model.  \n   - Subcategory field: the subcategory of the product, a foreign key from the Subcategory model.   \n   - SKU field: alphanumeric code assigned for a product.  \n   - Name field: the name of the product, a required field.  \n   - Has_sizes: has a boolean value - Yes for shoes, No for accessories.  \n   - Price: the price of the product, a required field.  \n   - Rating: the rating of the product. Each product has an initial rating value given by the retailer based on its quality from the manufacturer. The default value is 3. Each time a user gives a rating to the product, it calculates the average and updates this field (read more about this in Feature section - Add Review).  \n   - Image: the image of the product.  \n   - Total_purchased: the quantity purchased for this product. The initial (default) value is 0. Each time a user purchases the product, the value also adds up.   \n\n- **User model**    \n   - Stores registration information of a user, the model was created as one of the components of Django's authentication system (more information on this, see [django.contrib.auth](https:\/\/docs.djangoproject.com\/en\/4.0\/ref\/contrib\/auth\/)). The fields include (but are not limited to) username, email, and password.  \n\n- **Order model**  \n   - Stores all information related to a successfully placed order.  \n   - Order_number field: a unique order number generated automatically using UUID.  \n   - User_profile field: the user that ordered, a foreign key from the UserProfile model (if the user is registered).  \n   - Full_name field: the full name of the buyer.  \n   - Email field: the email address of the buyer.  \n   - Phone_number: the phone number of the buyer.  \n   - Street_address1: the first line of street address of the buyer.  \n   - Street_address2: the second line of the street address of the buyer.  \n   - Town_or_city: the town or city name of the buyer.  \n   - Postcode: the postcode of the buyer.  \n   - Country: the country of the buyer.  \n   - Date: the date of purchase.  \n   - Delivery_cost: the delivery cost of the transaction.  \n   - Order_total: the total price of the order (the total quantity times individual product price).  \n   - Grand_total: the order_total + delivery_cost.  \n   - Original_bag: a JSON object of the products and sizes that were in the bag.  \n   - Stripe_pid: a payment intent id from the stripe for a successful order.  \n\n- **OrderLineItem model**  \n   - Stores order details of a product that has been purchased.  \n   - Product field: the product ordered, a foreign key from the Product model.  \n   - Order field: the order number for this product ordered, a foreign key from the Order model.  \n   - Product_size field: the size of the product ordered.  \n   - Quantity field: the quantity of the product ordered.  \n   - Lineitem_total field: the quantity times the individual product price.    \n\n- **UserProfile model**   \n   - Stores user's address information for registered user.  \n   - User field: the user itself, a foreign key from the User model.  \n   - Default_phone_number field: the phone number of the user.  \n   - Default_street_address1 field: the first line of the street address of the user.  \n   - Default_street_address2 field: the second line of the street address of the user.  \n   - Default_town_or_city field: the town or city name of the user.  \n   - Default_postcode field: the postcode of the user.  \n   - Default_country field: the country of the user.    \n\n- **Review model**   \n   - Stores user's review of products that the user had previously purchased.  \n   - Product field: the reviewed product, a foreign key from the Product model.  \n   - User field: the user itself, a foreign key from UserProfile.  \n   - Rating: the rating that the user gave for the product.  \n   - Review_text: the review that the user gave for the product.  \n   - Date: the date it was created.  \n\n- **Blog model**   \n   - Stores articles\/ blogs for the website.  \n   - Image field: the image for the article.   \n   - Author field: the author of the article, a foreign key from the User model.  \n   - Title field: the title for the article.  \n   - Paragraph1: the first paragraph of the article.  \n   - Paragraph2: the second paragraph of the article.  \n   - Paragraph3: the third paragraph of the article.  \n   - Created_on: the data it was created.  \n\n- **Favorites model**  \n   - Stores list of favorite products of a registered user.  \n   - User: the user that created the favorites list, a foreign key from the User model.  \n   - Products field: the list of products.   \n   - Because there would be a many-to-many relationship between favorites and products, i.e. one product can be listed in multiple (users) favorites, and one favorite can have multiple products, I decided to define a through\/ intermediary model between the two models ([source from Django documentation](https:\/\/docs.djangoproject.com\/en\/4.0\/ref\/models\/fields\/#django.db.models.ManyToManyField.through_fields)). The through model named  **FavoritesItem model**, which stores each product in one table with favorites as a foreign key.  \n\n- **Topic model**  \n  - Stores the topics of the contact form.  \n  - Subject field: a one-word name for database purposes.  \n  - Text field: a longer name for display on the contact form.  \n  - I decided to make this into a separate model instead of a choice field because I wanted to define separate naming fields for database and display, and for future flexibility in adding\/ editing\/ removing a topic.   \n\n- **ContactForm model**  \n  - Stores the contact form filled by the user.  \n  - Name field: the name of the user.  \n  - Email field: the email of the user.  \n  - Topic field: the topic of the message, a foreign key from the Topic model.  \n  - Order_number: the order number if the user has it. Filled manually by the user.  \n  - Message: the message in the form.  \n  - Date: the date it was sent.    \n\n\n[Back to top &uarr;](https:\/\/github.com\/dissyulina\/shoesandmore#shoes-and-more)  \n\n<br\/>  \n\n## **FEATURES**  \n### **A. General Design Features**  \n- **Fully responsive** - Each page of the site is fully responsive on all device sizes (with a minimum dimension of 320px or an iPhone 4\/5) and features intuitive navigational buttons.  \n\n- **Navbar** (on all pages)   \n   ![The Navbar on desktop](readme-testing-files\/readme\/navbar-desktop.png \"The Navbar on desktop\")   \n\n   - The Navbar is responsive and turns to a hamburger menu on a smaller device. It is also sticky, thus it follows along when the user scrolls down, so the user can easily navigate the site without scrolling back to the top.  \n   - The logo is placed at the top center of the Navbar, creating a symmetrical visual between left and right, and links back to the Home page.  \n   - A search box is positioned on the left side of the Navbar, providing the ease of searching a keyword from the beginning.   \n   - For unregistered users, the Sign In buttons are visible right away, conventionally placed at the top-right of the page. It's a dropdown link that will give options to Register or log in. After the user successfully logged in, the previously Sign In button turns into a My Account dropdown button, which provides the links to My Profile and Log Out.  \n   - Favorites and Shopping Bag links are placed on the Navbar to give quick access from any page the user is currently at.   \n   - There are 6 nav-links to navigate between products categories and subcategories - All Products, Women, Men, Kids, Accessories, and Sale.  \n   - A sales banner about free delivery is placed right below the Navbar, and also displayed on all pages.  \n\n- **Footer** (on all pages)  \n   ![The Footer on desktop](readme-testing-files\/readme\/footer-desktop.png \"The Footer on desktop\") \n   The Footer uses the same color as the Navbar and provides all navigation links, the social media links of the store as well (that opens in a new tab), and the logo that leads back to the Home page. Here we also have links to the Articles, the FAQ page, and the Contact page. Since the main business of Shoes And More is selling shoes and accessories, these three pages although still important, are not the main pages of the site.  Therefore the links to these pages are only available on the footer, which can be found at the bottom of every page nevertheless.  \n\n- **Toast message**   \nToast messages provide the user the necessary feedback on their activities whether it's successfully executed or not. The toast messages are color-coded: red for error messages, blue for info\/ alert messages, yellow for warning messages, and green for success messages. Users will get a success toast the most, for example when users add a product to the shopping bag, they will get a success toast message with a bag display. When users for example add a product to their favorites list, they will get a success toast message without a bag display. Below are the examples of success toast messages (without the bag and with the bag display).   \n![Success toast message - without bag display](readme-testing-files\/readme\/toast-suceess-nobag.png \"Success toast message - without bag display\")\n![Success toast message - with bag display](readme-testing-files\/readme\/toast-success.png \"Success toast message - with bag display\")   \n\n- **Error Pages**  \nError pages for 403, 404, and 500 errors were created to ensure a great user experience even when the user encounters an error. Users can be informed of the error and can easily navigate back to the homepage.   \n\n\n### **B. Page Features**  \n#### **1. Home Page**  \n[See the image of the Homepage here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/home-page.png)   \n- On the Home page, I used multiple images as a marketing strategy to attract users' attention to browse more into the website, and hopefully make a purchase.  \n- The hero-image covers 100% of the viewport height and width, with an impactful heading in a jumbotron to give the user a great first impression. It introduces the new arrivals, which are products for spring, with a CTA button to directly browse the new arrivals.  \n- The sneakers collection section provides direct navigation to the sneakers.  \n- The shoes for the whole family section provides direct navigation to the main categories based on gender\/ age: Women, Men, and Kids.  \n- The best sellers section gives information to users on which products have been purchased the most, which indicates the most popular products. The products are displayed in a multi-item carousel of 8 products. If a product is purchased, the quantity of purchase will accumulate for each product. To get the 'best sellers' products, all products will be sorted according to their total purchased quantity from highest to lowest, and the 8 products with the highest quantity are displayed in this section.   \n- The final sale section provides direct navigation to the sale products.   \n- The bags and accessories section provides direct navigation to the accessories products.  \n- The articles and blogs section displays the latest 3 articles written by store admin or other superusers. Users can also navigate to the articles page and view all articles by clicking the See More Articles button.  \n\n#### **2. Products Page**  \n[See the image of Products page here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/products.png)   \n- The Products page starts with breadcrumb navigation that indicates the current page\u2019s location within a navigational hierarchy. For example, if the user chose the Women Sneakers, then the breadcrumb will show Home > Women > Sneakers.  \n- Below the breadcrumb, there's a 'Final Sale' banner, as normally, users are interested in checking out the sale items first. If users click the shop now button, it will filter the products to display only the sale items. This Sale banner is not displayed on mobiles to save space.  \n- The side Navigation feature (only on desktop) helps users to quickly navigate through the categories and subcategories and will filter the products to display only the categories and subcategories of choice. On smaller devices, users can click the hamburger icon to navigate.   \n- The Side Navigation can't be applied on mobiles and tablets due to the limitation of space. To replace it, a dropdown button is available on mobiles and tablets in order to provide the same functionality to navigate throughout subcategories.  \n- The result of products displayed can also be sorted by price (lowest to highest and highest to lowest), rating (highest to lowest), popularity\/ best sellers (highest to lowest), and name (A to Z).  \n- The products are displayed in 4 columns on a large screen, 3 columns on a medium screen, and 2 columns on a small screen.   \n- On the top right of each product's image, there's a heart icon that turns red when the user hovers over it. By clicking this icon, a registered user can add the product to their favorites list. The heart icon will then turns red to indicate that the product has been listed in the user's favorites.  \n- A back-to-top button is fixed positioned on the right side of the screen.  \n\n#### **3. Individual Product Page**  \n[See the image of Individual Product page here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/individual-product-page.png)  \n- The Individual Product page starts with breadcrumb navigation that indicates the current page\u2019s location within a navigational hierarchy.  \n- The page features the product's image, name, price, rating, category tag, and reviews at the bottom of the page.  \n- On the top right of the product's image, there's a heart icon that turns red when the user hovers over it. By clicking this icon, a registered user can add the product to their favorites list. The heart icon will then turns red to indicate that the product has been listed in the user's favorites.  \n- Users can add the product to their shopping bag by choosing the size and the quantity, and then click Add to Bag button.  \n\n**Review Section** \n- Under the product information, there's a review section that lists all the reviews for the product. If a user has written a review for the product before, the buttons to edit and delete show up below it. A registered user is able to edit or delete their own review.   \n   Below is the example, if I logged in as user \"Janedoe\".   \n   ![Edit and Delete Review buttons](readme-testing-files\/readme\/review-edit-delete-button.png \"Edit and Delete Review buttons\")    \n   If the user clicks the Edit button, they will be directed to the Edit Review page [see Edit Review page](https:\/\/github.com\/dissyulina\/shoesandmore#11-add-edit-review-page).   \n   While if the user clicks the Delete button, a confirmation modal will pop out to confirm if the user really wants to delete it.    \n   ![Confirmation modal before deleting review](readme-testing-files\/readme\/delete-review-modal.png \"Confirmation modal before deleting review\")  \n\n\n#### **4. Favorites Page**  \n[See the image of Favorites page here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/favorites-page.png)  \n- The Favorites page features all products that the user has been saved as their favorites. The products are displayed in resemblance with the products page, using the product's image, name, price, and rating. They are displayed in 4 columns on a large screen, 3 columns on a medium screen, and 2 columns on a small screen.  \n- The heart icon on the top right of the product's image is replaced by a trash icon, which indicates its function to remove the product from favorites.  \n- Since favorites are a list of products that the user is interested in and willing to buy, below each product, there is an option to choose the size and an Add to Bag button. This allows users to add the product to their shopping bag directly and easily, without going to the individual product page.   \n\n#### **5. Bag Page**  \n[See the image of Bag page here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/bag-page.png)  \n- The Bag page features all products that the user has been added to the shopping bag, and the total price that the user has to pay (if the user decides to continue). On this page, users can adjust the products' quantity, or remove the products from the bag.  \n- It displays the products' information such as product's image, name, SKU, price, size of choice, and quantity of choice.  \n- A trash icon is placed on each product's row, which indicates that users can use this button to remove the specified product from their bag.  \n- The subtotal column informs users of the product's price times the quantity. If the user changes the quantity, the subtotal changes accordingly.  \n- The total price, the delivery price, and the total are separated in a box, to gain the user's attention on what the next action is. A CTA button to checkout and visual information of the accepted method of payments are placed in the box as well.  \n- If the user decides to browse for more products, a Keep Shopping button is positioned below the total box as a secondary option.   \n\n#### **6. Checkout Page**  \n[See the image of Checkout page here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/checkout-page.png)  \n- The Checkout page features the checkout form to process the transaction and the order information.  \n- The Checkout form is divided into 3 sections: Details (user's full name and email), Delivery (user's delivery address), and Payment (user's card detail.  \n- The order information is filled with a summary of all products from the Bag page, along with the total. CTA buttons are present inside the box for the user to pay and therefore complete the order, or go back to Adjust bag as a secondary option.  \n\n#### **7. Checkout Success Page**   \n[See the image of Checkout Sucess page here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/checkout-success-page.png)  \n- The Checkout Success page features the summary of order transactions that had just been successfully processed, right after the user proceeds to complete the order on the Checkout page.  \n- Users can see the Order information, items list, delivery address, and billing information.\n- Registered users can also find this summary of orders on their Profile page.  \n\n#### **8. Profile Page - My Information**  \n[See the image of Profile page - My Information here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/profile-information-page.png)  \n- The Profile page features three pill sections - My Information, My Purchases, and Ratings\/ Reviews.  \n- In the My Information section, users can update their delivery information. This information will pre-populate the Checkout form for future transactions so that registered users don't have to fill it out all over again. They just have to fill in the payment information.   \n- By changing the input fields and clicking the Update Information button, the delivery information is updated in the database.  \n\n#### **9. Profile Page - My Purchases**  \n[See the image of Profile page - My Purchases here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/profile-orderhistory-page.png)  \n- On My Purchases section, users can view all their order history, sorted by order date (from the earliest to the latest).  \n- Each order number can be clicked, and it will lead to the Checkout Success page of the order, so that user can see the detail information of that particular order.  \n\n\n#### **10. Profile Page - Ratings\/Reviews**  \n[See the image of Profile page - Ratings\/Reviews here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/profile-reviews-page.png)  \n- In the Ratings\/ Reviews section, users can view all products that they have purchased before and are waiting to be reviewed. Users can only review products that they have purchased before so that they can give trustworthy reviews of the products.  \n- Users can give ratings and reviews by clicking the Give Review button on the right side of the product. They will then be directed to the Add Review page.   \n- After the review for a product is added, the product will be removed from this section.  \n\n#### **11. Add\/ Edit Review Page**  \n[See the image of Add\/ Edit Review page here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/add-edit-review-page.png)  \n- The Add Review page features a form to submit ratings and reviews for the specified product. Users can give a rating (range from 1 to 5), and\/or a review of the product. The rating is required (users can't submit the form if the rating is empty), while the review text input is not.  \n- To submit the rating and review, a Submit Review button is placed below the form. There's also a Cancel button which will bring users back to their profile (review section).  \n- After the review is submitted, users are directed back to their profile (review section) as well, to encourage users to review more products.  \n- Even though there are two separate templates each for Add Review page and Edit Review page, the display and layout are exactly the same between the two. The only difference is, on the Edit Review page, the rating input and review text area are already prepopulated with the existing rating and review from the user.  \n- As mentioned above on the Individual Product page, user can edit their review by accessing the Individual Product page first, finding the review, and then clicking the Edit button.  \n\n#### **12. Articles Page**  \n[See the image of Articles page here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/articles-page.png)  \n- The Articles page features all relevant articles about shoes and accessories. This provides better customer experiences besides basic purchasing functionality and hopefully will increase users' engagement with the store.   \n- All articles are featured in a card-like display, with an image, a title, a small part of the article, and a Read the article link that will bring the user to the Individual Article page.   \n\n#### **13. Individual Article Page**  \n[See the image of Articles page here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/individual-article-page.png)  \n- The Individual Article page features the article itself, the image, the title, and the date created.   \n- Read more articles button is placed on the bottom-center of the page to bring users back to the Articles page.  \n\n#### **14. FAQ Page**  \n[See the image of FAQ page here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/faq-page.png)  \n- The FAQ page features frequently asked questions about payment, order, return policy, etc. Users can access this page by clicking the FAQ link on the footer.  \n- If users can't find their answers on this page, they are invited to contact the store directly by clicking the Go to Contact Page button placed on the bottom-center of the page.  \n\n#### **15. Contact Page**  \n[See the image of Contact page here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/contact-page.png)  \n- The Contact Page features information on how to contact the store. It provides a phone number, email address, and a contact form.  \n- Users can fill out the contact form and submit it. The server side will store it in the database so the store admin can see and process all of the messages.  \n\n#### **16. Register and Log In Page**  \n[See the image of Register page here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/register-page.png)  \n[See the image of Login page here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/login-page.png)  \n- The Register\/ Sign Up page allows users to register to the website. To register, users have to provide an email address, username, and password. After registration, users will get an email confirmation that requires users to activate their account by clicking a link. Only after the account is activated, users can access the website as registered users.  \n- The login page allows registered users to log back into the website. To log in, users have to provide their email address or username, and password.  \n\n#### **17. Product Management \/ Add Product page (Admin \/ Superuser only)**  \n[See the image of Product Management page here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/add-product-page.png)  \n- The Product Management page is only available for Admin or Superuser. This page can be accessed by clicking My Account on the Navbar after logging in as an admin.  \n- The Product Management page features a form that functions to add a product to the store. On this form, the admin can fill out the category, subcategory, SKU, name, has sizes (true or false), price, rating, and image.  \n- To submit the new product, an Add Product button is placed on the bottom-center of the page. A cancel button is available as well which will direct them to the products page.  \n\n#### **18. Edit Product page (Admin \/ Superuser only)**  \n[See the image of Edit Product page here](readme-testing-files\/readme\/edit-product-page.png)  \n- The Edit Product page is only available for Admin or Superuser. This page can be accessed by clicking the Edit link that is available on each product on the Products page, or on the Individual Product page, after logging in as an admin.  \n- The Edit Product page's design and layout are the same as Add Product page to give a sense of consistency and minimal learning curve for the admin.  \n- To edit the product, an Update Product button is placed on the bottom-center of the page. A cancel button is available as well which will direct them back to the products page.  \n\n#### **19. Delete Product Functionality (Admin \/ Superuser only)**  \n- The Edit Product functionality is only available for Admin or Superuser. This functionality can be accessed by clicking the Edit link that is available on each product on the Products page, or on the Individual Product page, after logging in as an admin.  \n- After the admin clicks the Delete button, a confirmation modal will pop out to confirm if they want to delete it. The modal comes with the product name and image for the admin to be sure that it is the right product.  \n![Confirmation modal before deleting a product](readme-testing-files\/readme\/delete-product-modal.png \"Confirmation modal before deleting a product\")   \n\n\n[Back to top &uarr;](https:\/\/github.com\/dissyulina\/shoesandmore#shoes-and-more)  \n\n<br\/>  \n\n### **Features to be implemented in the future**\nDue to limited resources (time constraints, skill of the developer at the moment, and other reasons), some features couldn't be implemented now. There are so many potentials to develop this e-commerce website in the next development phase, adding more features and functionality. These features would be a great addition to the web app:  \n1. Adding more payment methods.  \n   While there are many methods of payments that can be implemented, because of time constraints, I could only add payments with cards. In the next development phase, more payment methods should be added, such as bank account debit, PayPal, Apple pay, etc, so that it would resemble a real e-commerce \/ online store website more.   \n2. Adding an option to sign in with social media.   \n   Social media logins make registration faster and easier and some users would prefer that. Websites can also gather profile- or social data for further analysis purposes. Social login also gives instant demographic and psychographic data about the customers, which can be used for better segmentation, website design, products, and so on.   \n3. Adding stock management for the products.  \n   Right now there is no stock field on the product model, so it's based on assumption that the logistic management is taken care of somewhere else (not on the website). It would be a great addition to the project to add stock management functionality, where the number of products available is also a field in the product table. When the number reaches a certain amount, it alerts a warning to restock the amount. If the number reaches 0, the product would not be displayed on the website until it's restocked.  \n4. Applying the Load More Products button functionality.   \n   For a perfect user experience, it would be better if not all products load altogether the first time, but rather just a number of them. Users will then decide if they want to see more products by clicking a Load More button. This ensures the products page loads faster the first time.  \n   I tried to implement this using AJAX, by passing the data from front-end to back-end back and forth. I could apply it, the button worked, but it didn't work with the category and subcategory filters, sorting, and favorites functionality. Due to time constraints and it was still half done, I decided to remove it and will instead implement it in the next development phase.   \n5. Completing the automated testing.  \n   Testing a web application is a complex task, because a web application is made of several layers of logic \u2013 from HTTP-level request handling, to form validation and processing, to template rendering. Due to time constraints, I didn't manage to complete all the automated testing in Django. In the next development phase, the automated testing has to be written, to ensure that the testing is already covered \"automatically\" thus it will save time to test as our site grows.   \n\n<br\/>   \n\n## **TESTING**  \n\nThe testing documentation can be found [here](https:\/\/github.com\/dissyulina\/shoesandmore\/blob\/main\/TESTING.md#shoes-and-more---testing).  \n\n[Back to top &uarr;](https:\/\/github.com\/dissyulina\/shoesandmore#shoes-and-more)  \n\n<br\/>\n\n## **ISSUES AND BUGS**   \nI ran into several issues and bugs while developing the website. Some of the tough ones are listed below, along with the solutions that successfully solved them.   \n1. **ISSUE** : For products that are in the favorites list of the user (that's currently logged in), the heart icon on the top left of the product image becomes red. I had difficulties in trying to implement this feature. I tried to check if the product is listed in the queryset of the users' favorites by defining this:   \n   In views.py:   \n   ```\n   products = Product.objects.all()  \n   favorites = Favorites.objects.filter(user=request.user) \n   ```\n   And in the template:  \n   ```\n   {% for product in product %} \n      ...\n      {% if product in favorites %}\n         <i class=\"fas fa-heart fa-inverse text-danger\"><\/i>\n      {% else %}\n         <i class=\"fas fa-heart fa-inverse\"><\/i>\n      {% endif %}\n      ...\n   {% enfor %}\n   ```\n   But that didn't work. I also tried a few other variations but failed to implement it.  \n   **SOLUTION** : The Code Institute's Tutor has helped me to figure out and to understand how to check if an instance exists in a query set, and how to define the correct query set. After going through the code, the solution was fairly simple:   \n   In views.py:   \n   ```\n   products = Product.objects.all()  \n   favorites = Favorites.objects.get(user=request.user) \n   ```\n   And in the template:  \n   ```\n   {% for product in product %} \n      ...\n      {% if product in favorites.products.all %}\n         <i class=\"fas fa-heart fa-inverse text-danger\"><\/i>\n      {% else %}\n         <i class=\"fas fa-heart fa-inverse\"><\/i>\n      {% endif %}\n      ...\n   {% enfor %}\n   ```\n   By this time I understood more on how to do this, which will affect my second problem.   \n\n2. **ISSUE** : The second problem was very similar to the first one. For every registered user, on their profile page, there's a review section. This review section lists all products that the user has bought before, and are waiting to be reviewed. Once the user gives a review of a product, the product will disappear from this section. Therefore, for this section, I wanted to display only the products that are in the user's order history, and are not listed in the reviews database. This problem was rather complicated because you have to check in multiple tables, and the process is not straightforward. Based on my understanding, this is what came to my mind.  \n   In views.py:   \n   ```\n   profile = get_object_or_404(UserProfile, user=request.user)\n   reviews = Review.objects.filter(user=profile)\n   orders = profile.orders.all()\n   ```\n   And in the template:  \n   ```\n   {% for order in orders %}\n      {% for item in order.lineitems.all %}\n         {% if item.product.id not in reviews %}\n            <!-- Display the products here -->\n            ...\n         {% endif %}\n      {% endfor %}\n   {% enfor %}\n   ```\n   **SOLUTION** : The above solution didn't work. After a few hours of googling and implementing, I found this topic on [Stack Overflow](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/51663212\/how-to-check-if-value-occurs-in-a-field-of-a-model-list-in-django) and learned about values_list(). I then read the documentation about [Django documentation about values_list](https:\/\/docs.djangoproject.com\/en\/4.0\/ref\/models\/querysets\/#values-list), which returns a QuerySet that returns single values (if using flat=True). Using this method, I changed the reviews variable in views.py to this:\n   ``` \n   reviews = Review.objects.filter(user=profile).values_list('product__id', flat=True)\n   ```\n   So that the reviews variable will just return a list of product_id values, thus will make it more straightforward to check if the id doesn't exist in the list: ```{% if item.product.id not in reviews %}```. This method worked and the products are displayed as I wanted originally.  \n  \n3. **ISSUE** : After a user gives a rating to a product, I wanted to update the product's rating by recalculating the average of the ratings. Each product has an initial rating given by the admin (the default rating is 3, but the admin can input another number). Here's the calculation example:   \n    Inital product rating = 3.6    \n    User A gives a rating = 5   \n    Updated product rating = (3.6 + 5) \/ 2 = 4.3   \n    User B gives a rating = 4   \n    Updated product rating = (3.6 + 5 + 4) \/ 3 = 4.2    \nIn this way, I would have to maintain two variables - the initial product rating, and the updated rating. I would have to get these variables and all ratings for this product to be able to recalculate the average each time a new rating is submitted.   \n**SOLUTION** : I was thinking about other ways to implement this, as I would prefer to have just one field for rating. And this rating will be updated with a new value each time a new rating is added. I finally find a math calculation to do this.   \n   If a user submits a new review\/rating:\n   ```  \n   product = get_object_or_404(Product, pk=product_id)\n\n   # We add 1 by the end to include the inital rating from admin  \n   total_product_reviews = Review.objects.filter(product=product.id).count() + 1\n\n   # Form review submitted by user\n   review = form.save(commit=False)\n\n   product.rating = (((product.rating * total_product_reviews) + review.rating) \/ (total_product_reviews + 1))\n   ```\n\n   If a user edits his\/her rating:\n   ``` \n   review = get_object_or_404(Review, pk=review_id)\n   product = review.product\n   edited_rating = review.rating\n   total_product_reviews = Review.objects.filter(product=product.id).count() + 1\n\n   product.rating = ((product.rating * total_product_reviews) - edited_rating + review.rating) \/ total_product_reviews\n   ``` \n\n   If a user deletes his\/her rating:\n   ```\n   review = get_object_or_404(Review, pk=review_id)\n   product = review.product\n   deleted_rating = review.rating\n   total_product_reviews = Review.objects.filter(product=product.id).count() + 1\n\n   product.rating = ((product.rating * total_product_reviews) - deleted_rating) \/ (total_product_reviews - 1)\n   ```   \n\n\n<br\/>  \n\n## **TECHNOLOGY USED**  \n### **Main Language**   \n   * [HTML5](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/HTML5)   \n   * [CSS3](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cascading_Style_Sheets)   \n   * [JavaScript](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/JavaScript)   \n   * [Python](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Python_(programming_language))   \n\n### **Libraries and Frameworks**  \n   * [Django](https:\/\/flickity.metafizzy.co\/)   \n   Flickity was used to build carousels on Home Page.   \n   * [Django Template](https:\/\/jinja.palletsprojects.com)  \n   Django Template was used as a templating language for Django to display backend data to HTML.   \n   * [Bootstrap 5](https:\/\/getbootstrap.com\/docs\/5.0\/getting-started\/introduction\/)  \n   Bootstrap 5 was used throughout the website to help with styling and responsiveness.  \n   * [Google Fonts](https:\/\/fonts.google.com)  \n   Google fonts was used to import the fonts into the html file, and were used on all parts of the site.  \n   * [Font Awesome](https:\/\/fontawesome.com)  \n   Font Awesome was used throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.   \n   * [jQuery 3.6.0](https:\/\/jquery.com\/)  \n   jQuery was used as a JavaScript library to help writing less JavaScript code.  \n   * [Flickity](https:\/\/flickity.metafizzy.co\/)   \n   Flickity was used to build carousels on Home Page.    \n\n### **Packages \/ Dependecies Installed**   \n   * [Django Allauth](https:\/\/django-allauth.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/)  \n   Django Allauth was used for user authentication, registration, and account management.  \n   * [Django Crispy Form](https:\/\/django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/)   \n   Django Crispy Form was used to control the rendering of the forms.  \n   * [Django Countries](https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/django-countries\/)   \n   Django Countries was used to provide country choices for use with forms and a country field for models.   \n   * [Pillow](https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/Pillow\/)  \n   Pillow was used to add image processing capabilities.  \n   * [Gunicorn](https:\/\/gunicorn.org\/)  \n   Gunicorn was used as Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX to support the deployment of Django application.  \n\n### **Database Management**  \n   * [SQLite](https:\/\/www.sqlite.com\/index.html)   \n   SQLite was used as a single-file databae in development.   \n   * [Heroku Postgres](https:\/\/www.heroku.com\/postgres)   \n   Heroku Postgres database was used in production, as a service based on PostgreSQL provided by Heroku.  \n\n### **Payment Service**  \n   * [Stripe](https:\/\/stripe.com\/en-gb-nl)  \n   Stripe was used to process the online payments for the transactions in the website.  \n\n### **Cloud Storage**  \n   * [Amazon Web Service S3](https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/s3\/)\n   AWS S3 was used to store all static and media files in production.  \n\n### **Tools and Programs**  \n   * [Git](https:\/\/git-scm.com)  \n   Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.  \n   * [GitHub](https:\/\/github.com)  \n   GitHub was used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git. \n   * [Heroku](https:\/\/www.heroku.com)   \n   Heroku was used to deploy the website.  \n   * [Figma](https:\/\/www.figma.com)  \n   Figma was used to create the wireframes and the high fidelity mock up during the design process.  \n   * [Autoprefixer CSS](https:\/\/autoprefixer.github.io)  \n   Autoprefixer CSS was used to add vendor prefixes to the CSS rules, to ensure that they work across all browsers.   \n   * [Am I Responsive](ami.responsivedesign.is)  \n   Am I Responsive was used to preview the website across a variety of popular devices.   \n   * [Photopea](https:\/\/www.photopea.com\/)   \n   Photopea is an online image editor to edit .ai file, and was used to edit the hero image.  \n   * [Tiny JPG](https:\/\/tinyjpg.com) and [Tiny PNG](https:\/\/tinypng.com)    \n   Tiny JPG and Tiny PNG were used to reduce the file size of the images.   \n   * [Coolors](https:\/\/coolors.co)  \n   Coolors was used to create a cohesive color scheme for the website.   \n\n\n[Back to top &uarr;](https:\/\/github.com\/dissyulina\/shoesandmore#shoes-and-more)  \n\n<br\/>  \n\n## **DEPLOYMENT**  \nThe project was developed using Gitpod as the IDE, committed to Git as a local repository, and pushed\/ stored to GitHub. The web application is deployed on Heroku because we can't host a Python project on Github pages, with static and media files stored in AWS S3. The repository itself is hosted on Github.  \n\n### **A. How To Use This Project**\nTo use and further develop this project you can either fork or clone the repository.  \n\n#### **Fork GitHub Repository**  \nBy forking the GitHub repository you can make a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account to view and\/or make changes without affecting the original repository, by using the following steps:  \n\n1. Log in to GitHub.  \n2. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub Repository that you want to fork.  \n3. At the top right of the Repository just below your profile picture, locate the \"Fork\" button.  \n4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.  \n5. Changes made to the forked repository can be merged with the original repository via a pull request.  \n\n#### **Clone Github Repository**  \nBy cloning a GitHub Repository you can create a local copy on your computer of the remote repository. The developer who clones a repository can synchronize their copy of the codebase with any updates made by fellow developers with push or pull request. Cloning is done by using the following steps:  \n\n1. Log in to GitHub.  \n2. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub Repository that you want to clone.  \n3. Above the list of files, click the dropdown called \"Code\".  \n4. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under \"HTTPS\", copy the link.  \n5. Open Git Bash.  \n6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.  \n7. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 4.  \n```$ git clone https:\/\/github.com\/YOUR-USERNAME\/YOUR-REPOSITORY```\n8. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.   \n```\n$ git clone https:\/\/github.com\/YOUR-USERNAME\/YOUR-REPOSITORY\n> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...\n> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.\n> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8\/8), done.\n> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)\n> Unpacking objects: 100% (10\/10), done.\n```  \nChanges made on the local machine (cloned repository) can be pushed to the upstream repository directly if you have a write access for the repository. Otherwise, the changes made in the cloned repository are first pushed to the forked repository, and then a pull request is created.  \nClick [Here](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/en\/github\/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories\/cloning-a-repository-from-github\/cloning-a-repository) to retrieve pictures for some of the buttons and more detailed explanations of the above process.  \n\n#### **Project Set Up After Forking or Cloning**   \n1. Install all dependencies by typing in the CLI ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```  \n2. Create a ```.gitignore``` file and ```env.py``` file in the project's root directory. Add the ```env.py``` file to ```.gitignore```. \n3. Inside the env.py file, enter the project's environment variables:   \n   ```\n   import os\n\n   os.environ.setdefault(\"SECRET_KEY\", <your_secret_key>)\n   os.environ.setdefault(\"DEVELOPMENT\", '1')\n   os.environ.setdefault(\"STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY\", <your_key>)\n   os.environ.setdefault(\"STRIPE_SECRET_KEY\", <your_key>)\n   os.environ.setdefault(\"STRIPE_WH_SECRET\", <your_key>)\n   ```   \n   You can get the keys from:\n   - \"SECRET_KEY\" can be generated using [Django Secret Key Generator](https:\/\/miniwebtool.com\/django-secret-key-generator\/)   \n   - \"STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY\" and \"STRIPE_SECRET_KEY\" can be generated by creating a stripe account. The keys are found in 'Developers' Section, under 'API Keys'.  \n   - In the Developer Section, under 'Webhooks', add a new endpoint.  \"STRIPE_WH_SECRET\". On Endpoint URL, enter:  \n   ``` https:\/\/<your_host_url>\/checkout\/wh\/ ```   \n   Select to listen to all events, and create endpoint, and you can view your \"STRIPE_WH_SECRET\".   \n\n4. Make migrations to setup the inital database operations.  \n   ``` \n   python3 manage.py makemigrations \n   python3 manage.py migrate \n   ```   \n5. Load all datas for the database.  \n   ```\n   python3 manage.py loaddata categories\n   python3 manage.py loaddata subcategories\n   python3 manage.py loaddata products\n   python3 manage.py loaddata topics\n   python3 manage.py loaddata blogs\n   ``` \n6. Create a super user.\n   ```\n   python3 manage.py create superuser\n   ```  \nThe project should now complete to run and can now be used for development. To run the project, type in the CLI terminal: ```python3 manage.py runserver```     \n\n<br\/>  \n\n### **B. Deployment to Heroku**  \nThis project is deployed on Heroku for production, with all static and media files stored on AWS S3. These are steps to deploy on Heroku:\n\n1. Navigate to Heroku.com, create a new account or login if you already have an account. On the dashboard page, click \"Create New App\" button. Give the app a name, the name must be unique with hypens between words. Set the region closest to you, and click \"Create App\".   \n2. On the resources tab, provision a new Heroku Postgres database.  \n3. Configure variables on Heroku by navigating to Settings, and click on Reveal Config Vars. You may not have all the values yet. Add the others as you progress through the steps.   \n   Varables | Key   \n   ---| ---   \n   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | your_access_key_id_from_AWS   \n   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | your_secret_access_key_from_AWS  \n   DATABASE_URL | your_database_url   \n   EMAIL_HOST_PASS | your_app_password_from_your_email   \n   EMAIL_HOST_USER | your_email_address  \n   SECRET_KEY | your_secret_key \n   STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | your_stripe_public_key  \n   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | your_stripe_secret_key  \n   USE_AWS | True \n\n4. If you haven't install it, install dj_database_url and psycopg2.\n   ```\n   pip3 install dj_database_url\n   pip3 install psycopg2-binary\n   ```\n   Note: you don't have to do this if you've installed all dependencies in the requirements.txt file.  \n5. Set up a new database for the site by going to the project's settings.py and importing dj_database_url. Comment out the database's default configuration, and replace the default database with a call to dj_database_url.parse and pass it the database URL from Heroku (you can get it from your config variables in your app setting tab)\n   ```\n   DATABASES = {\n     'default': dj_database_url.parse('YOUR_DATABASE_URL_FROM_HEROKU')\n   }\n   ```\n6. Run migrations\n   ```\n   python3 manage.py migrate\n   ```  \n7. Import all products, topics (for contact form), and blogs data. I'm using fixtures json files, use therefore the loaddata method.  \n   ```\n   python3 manage.py loaddata categories\n   python3 manage.py loaddata subcategories\n   python3 manage.py loaddata products\n   python3 manage.py loaddata topics\n   python3 manage.py loaddata blogs\n   ```\n8. Set up a new superuser, fill out the username, email address, and password.\n   ```\n   python3 manage.py create superuser\n   ```  \n9. Remove the database config from Heroku and uncomment the original config. Add a conditional statement to define that when the app is running on Heroku. we connect to Postgres, and otherwise, we connect to Sqlite.   \n   ```\n   if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:\n      DATABASES = {\n         'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))\n      }\n   else:\n      DATABASES = {\n         'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n            'NAME': BASE_DIR \/ 'db.sqlite3',\n         }\n      }\n   ```  \n10. Install gunicorn (if you haven't) which will act as the webserver, and put it on the requirements.txt.   \n   ``` \n   pip3 install gunicorn\n   pip3 freeze > requirements.txt\n   ```\n   Note: you don't have to do this if you've installed all dependencies in the requirements.txt file.  \n11. Create a Procfile, to tell Heroku to create a web dyno, which will run unicorn and serve the Django app.   \n\n   Inside the Procfile:\n   ```\n   web: gunicorn shoes_and_more.wsgi:application\n   ```\n12. Login to Heroku through CLI, using ```heroku login```. Once logged in, disable the collect static temporarily, so that Heroku won't try to collect static files when it deploys.\n   ```\n   heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app shoes-and-more\n   ```\n   And add the hostname of the Heroku app to allowed hosts in the project's settings.py, and also add localhost so that Gitpod will still work as well:  \n   ```\n   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['shoes-and-more.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']\n   ```   \n13. Add, commit, and push to gitpod and then to Heroku. After pushing to gitpod as usual, initialize git remote first:\n   ```\n   heroku git:remote -a shoes-and-more\n   ``` \n   Then push to Heroku:\n   ```\n   git push heroku main\n   ```\n14. Go to the app's dashboard on Heroku and go to Deploy. Connect the app to Github by clicking Github and search for the repository. Click connect. Also enable the automatic deploy by clicking Enable Automatic Deploys, so that everytime we push to github, the code will automatically be deployed to Heroku as well.  \n15. Go back to settings.py and replace the secret key setting with the call to get it from the environment, and use empty string as a default. \n   ```\n   SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')\n   ```\n   Set debug to be true only if there's a variable called development in the environment.\n   ```\n   DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ\n   ```\n   \n<br\/>  \n\n### **C. AWS Bucket Creation**   \nAll static and media files in this project are stored in [Amazon Web Services S3 bucket](https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/) which is a cloud based storage service. You can create your own bucket by following these steps:   \n1. Go to [Amazon Web Service website](https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/) and click on Create An AWS Account, or login if you already have an account.  \n2. Login to your new account, go to AWS Management Console and find service S3. Click on Create Bucket.   \n   - Give it a name (I recommend naming your bucket to match the Heroku app name), and choose region closest to you.  \n   - In Object Ownership section, choose ACLS enabled. and Bucket Owner Preffered.   \n   - Uncheck box 'Block All Public Access'.  \n   - Check box 'I acknowledge that the current settings might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public.'  \n   - Click on Create Bucket, and your bucket is created.  \n3. Click on your newly created bucket, and navigate to the Properties tab. Scroll down to the bottom until you find Static Website Hosting. Click on Edit, then enable. \n   - Hosting type: choose Host a Static Website   \n   - Index document: index.html  \n   - Error document: error.html\n   - Click on Save Changes.  \n4. Navigate to the Permissions tab. Scroll down to the bottom until you find Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). Click on Edit, and paste in this Cors Configuration below, which is going to set up the required access between the Heroku app and this S3 bucket. Click on Save Changes. \n   ```\n   [\n      {\n         \"AllowedHeaders\": [\n            \"Authorization\"\n         ],\n         \"AllowedMethods\": [\n            \"GET\"\n         ],\n         \"AllowedOrigins\": [\n            \"*\"\n         ],\n         \"ExposeHeaders\": []\n      }\n   ]\n   ```   \n   Still on the Permissions tab, find Bucket policy, click on Edit, and then go to Policy Generator. \n   - Select Type of Policy: choose S3 Bucket Policy   \n   - Effect: choose Allow   \n   - Principal: *   \n   - Actions: select GetObject   \n   - Fill in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), from the Bucket ARN back in the Bucket Policy   \n   - Click on the Add Statement and then Generate Policy. Copy the policy and paste in the bucket policy editor.  \n   - Add a slash star on to the end of the resource key (because we want to allow access to all resources in this bucket). Click Save.\n      The resource key should look like this\n      ```  \n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME\/*\",  \n      ```  \n   \n   Still on Permissions tab, go to Access Control List (ACL) section, click Edit and enable List for Everyone (public access), and accept the warning box.  \n\n5. With the bucket ready, now we need to create a user to access it through another service called IAM which stands for Identity and Access Management. Go back to the service menu and open IAM.   \n   a. Create a group for our user to live in.  \n      Click User Groups, and then create a new group with a name you want. I gave the group the name: manage-shoes-and-more. Scroll down to the bottom and click on Create Group.     \n   b. Create an access policy giving the group access to the S3 bucket that has been created.  \n      - Click on Policy, and then Create Policy. Go to the JSON tab, and then select import managed policy, which will let us import one that AWS has pre-built for full access to S3. Search for S3, then import the AmazonS3FullAccess policy.   \n      - Because we only want to allow full access to our new bucket and everything within it, paste the bucket ARN (from the bucket policy page in s3) in the JSON editor.\n      ```\n      \"Resource\": [\n         \"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME\",\n         \"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME\/*\"\n      ]\n      ```  \n      Now click on Next:Tags, then click Next:Review. \n      - Give the review policy a name and a description, then click Create Policy. The policy has now been created. \n      \n   c. Finally, assign the user to the group so it can use the policy to access all our files.  \n      - Go to User Groups, and select the group. Go to the Permissions tab, open the Add Permissions dropdown, and click Attach Policies.  \n      - Select the policy and click Add permissions at the bottom.  \n      - Create a user to put in the group, by going to the Users page, and clicking Add Users.  \n      - Set a user name, give them access type: Programmatic access, and then click Next: Permissions.   \n      - Check on the group that has the policy attached. Click Next: Tags, then click Next: Review, and lastly Create User.     \n      - Download the csv file and save it.  \n\n<br\/>  \n\n### **D. Connect Django to AWS Bucket**   \nNote: If you've forked the repository, all of these steps are already done\/ written on the files. Make sure you've installed all dependencies in the requirements.txt file, add all the AWS-related Config Vars to Heroku, and remove the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable from Heroku.   \nHere are the steps I took to connect Django to AWS:  \n1. Install two new packages: boto3 and django-storages. Freeze them into requirements.txt.   \n   ```\n   pip3 install boto3\n   pip3 install django-storages \n   pip3 freeze > requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n2. Add storages to the Installed Apps in settings.py.\n3. In settings.py, we need to set cache control, set bucket configurations, set static and media files location, and override static and media URLs in production. We'll only want to do this on Heroku, so add an if statement as well.\n   ```\n   if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:\n      # Cache control\n      AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {\n         'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',\n         'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',\n      }\n\n      # Bucket Config\n      AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME'\n      AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'YOUR_REGION'\n      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')\n      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')\n      AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'\n\n      # Static and media files\n      STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'\n      STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'\n      DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'\n      MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media' \n\n      # Override static and media URLs in production\n      STATIC_URL = f'https:\/\/{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}\/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}\/'\n      MEDIA_URL = f'https:\/\/{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}\/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}\/'\n   ```\n   Set the Config Vars on Heroku. On your app's dashboard on Heroku, go to Settings and click Reveal Convig Vars. Set this variables:\n   Variables | Value\n   --- | ---\n   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | your access key id from the csv file that you've downloaded before\n   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | your secret access key from the csv file that you've downloaded before\n   USE_AWS | True    \n\n   Also remove the COLLECTSTATIC variable from the Config Vars.   \n\n4. We then want to tell Django that in production we want to use S3 to store our static files whenever someone runs collectstatic, and that we sent any uploaded images to go there as well.  \nCreate a custom_storages.py file in your project's root directory, and inside it, include the Static and Media Storage locations: \n   ```\n   from django.conf import settings\n   from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage\n \n\n   class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):\n      location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION\n\n\n   class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):\n      location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION\n   ```  \n\n5. Finally, push these changes on Github.\n   ```\n   git add .\n   git commit -m \"Your commit message\"\n   git push\n   ```  \n\n\n[Back to top &uarr;](https:\/\/github.com\/dissyulina\/shoesandmore#shoes-and-more)  \n\n<br\/>\n\n\n## **CREDITS**   \n### **A.
